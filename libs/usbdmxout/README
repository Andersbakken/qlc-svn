This file describes the output plugin that can be used to handle the
Peperoni Light USB interfaces directly in QLC. There is no need to have the dmx4linux 
package installed.
This is meant as a solution to run QLC on kernels 2.6 and above as long as no
dmx4linux drivers are available for the 2.6 kernels.
However, dmx4linux IS the primary driver architecture that should be used
with QLC.


Getting things working:

1) Download the Peperoni driver from:
http://qlc.sourceforge.net/packages/PeperoniDriver.tar.gz

2) Do the usual tar -xzf Peperoni*

3) Change into the driver directory

4) Make sure you have the headers of your currently running kernel installed.
   The driver assumes they are in /lib/modules/<kernel version>/build

5) In the driver directory type: 
   make k26

6) If all went well, load the driver with
   insmod usbdmx.ko

7) A "tail -f /var/log/messages" in a separate console
   is a good idea to see what is going on.

8) the /dev/usbdmx0 device node will be created on the fly.
   It will have permissions set to allow only root accessing 
   the /dev/usbdmx 
   If you are working as normal user, you have to add an entry to
   /etc/udev/permissions.rules
   like
   KERNEL=="usbdmx[0-16]*", MODE="0666"

8.1) On Fedora Core (5), there is a /etc/udev/rules.d/ directory. Create
     a new file called "usbdmx.rules" in that directory, and put the above
     line in that file, instead of the "permissions.rules" file (it doesn't
     probably even exist on Fedora boxes). Make sure the file is owned
     by root.root with permissions 644 (chown root.root * ; chmod 644 *).

9) In the new QLC version go to File->Settings and select usb2dmx Rodin from
   the output plugin setting and activate it.

10) If you wish the driver to load automatically, type (as root):
    "cp usbdmx.ko /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/drivers/usb/misc"
    and also "depmod -a" to make sure the driver is correctly compiled etc.

ERRORS

1) At least on Fedora Core 5 (2.6.16-2122-FC5smp) the driver doesn't compile
   without problems. So, you might get an error message that looks like this:

   /home/hjunnila/usbdmx-driver-v2.0/usbdmx.c:636: error: unknown field
   'owner' specified in initializer
   /home/hjunnila/usbdmx-driver-v2.0/usbdmx.c:636: warning: initialization
   from incompatible pointer type

Solution:
   You should edit the usbdmx.c file at line number 636 (almost at the end):
--------------
#if LINUX_VERSION_CODE >= KERNEL_VERSION(2,4,0)
  .owner      = THIS_MODULE,
#endif
--------------
  Comment the line with /* and */ or just remove it and then recompile.
--------------
#if LINUX_VERSION_CODE >= KERNEL_VERSION(2,4,0)
  /* .owner      = THIS_MODULE, */
#endif
-------------


The plugin is still somewhat experimental, please tell me about any problems.
