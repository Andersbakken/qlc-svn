This file describes the output plugin that can be used to handle the
Peperoni Light USB interfaces directly in QLC. There is no need to have the dmx4linux 
package installed.
This is ment as a solution to run QLC on kernels 2.6 and above as long as no
dmx4linux drivers are available for the 2.6 kernels.
However, dmx4linus IS the primary driver architecture that should be used
with QLC.


Getting things working:

1) Download the Peperoni driver from:
http://qlc.sourceforge.net/packages/PeperoniDriver.tar.gz

2) Do the usual tar -xzf Peperoni*

3) Change into the driver directory

4) Make sure you have the headers of your 
   currently running kernel installed.

5) In the driver directory type: 
   make k26

6) If all went well, load the driver with
   insmod usbdmx.ko

7) A "tail -f /var/log/messages" in a separate console
   is a good idea to see what is going on.

8) the /dev/usbdmx0 device node will be created on the fly.
   It will have permissions set to allow only root accessing 
   the /dev/usbdmx 
   If you are working as normal user, you have to add an entry to
   /etc/udev/permissions.rules
   like
   KERNEL=="usbdmx[0-16]*", MODE="0666"

9) In the new QLC version go to File->Settings and select usb2dmx Rodin from the 
output plugin setting and activate it.


The plugin is still somewhat experimental, please tell me about any problems.
