This file describes the output plugin that can be used to handle the Peperoni
Light USB interfaces directly in QLC.

Getting the USBDMX driver:

1) Get the Peperoni driver from QLC subversion repository:
   svn co https://qlc.svn.sf.net/svnroot/qlc/usbdmx-driver usbdmx-driver

2) cd usbdmx-driver

3) Read the ReadMe file that comes along with the driver package and do as it
   says. You will have a usbdmx.ko driver after the procedures, if all went
   well.

4) Start QLC. It doesn't matter, whether you install it from a binary package
   or whether you compile it before or after the driver installation.

Please tell us of any problems you might encounter!
