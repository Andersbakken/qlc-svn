This is an ancient version of libusb tailored for OSX. It seems to work better
than libusb-legacy 0.1.12 from macports. Well, it compiles out of the box and
works with USB devices (Peperoni, Enttec, uDMX(?))) with no problems.

These files were taken from an FTDI mac package. Since the sources are
originally under LGPL, there really shouldn't be any licensing issues.

Maybe we can one day get rid of these sources and start using something more
correct(tm). Feel free to try something, but make sure libusb exists as a
static library inside plugins (or QLC???). Yeah, it's a bit dumb since it's
also available as a shared library. However, static is MUCH easier for the
average user who knows nothing about libusb, why it's needed or where to get it.
