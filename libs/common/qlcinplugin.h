/**
 * QLCInPlugin is an interface for all input plugins. Input plugins provide
 * input data from various (external) gadgets, such as slider wings, for
 * example.
 *
 * Each plugin can be understood as an adaptation layer between QLC and a
 * protocol used by a certain family of input devices. For example, a MIDI
 * input plugin can provide input support for a multitude of various MIDI
 * devices. Each of the devices currently connected to the computer can then
 * be represented as a separate input line by the MIDI plugin. Each plugin
 * must provide at least one input line for QLC in order to work properly.
 * Then again, if there are no such devices currently connected to the computer
 * that would be supported by the plugin, the plugin can choose to provide no
 * lines at all (until the user plugs in a supported device).
 *
 * When QLC has successfully loaded an input plugin, it will call init()
 * exactly once for each plugin. After that, it is assumed that either the
 * plugin auto-senses the devices it supports or the user must manually try
 * to search for new devices thru a custom configuration dialog that can be
 * opened with configure(). connectInputData() is also called exactly once
 * for each plugin to make a signal-slot connection between the plugin and
 * QLC.
 *
 * Plugins should not leave any resources open unless open() is called. And
 * even then, the plugin should open only such resources that are needed for
 * the specific input line given in the call to open(). Respectively, when
 * close() is called, the plugin should relinquish all resources associated to
 * the closed input line (unless shared with other lines).
 *
 * Plugins have a name that is shown to users as a list item. Each input
 * line name, preceded by its index, is shown under the plugin name as a
 * selectable list entry. Therefore, these names should be descriptive, but
 * relatively short. Input line indices are shown on the UI as 1-based, but
 * they are still handled internally as 0-based.
 *
 * An info text can be fetched for each plugin with infoText(). If the input
 * parameter == KInputInvalid, the plugin should provide a brief status snippet
 * on its overall state. If the input line parameter is given, the plugin
 * should provide information concerning ONLY that particular input line.
 * This info is displayed to the user as-is.
 *
 * Feedback values going the other way from QLC towards input devices is done
 * with feedbackData(). This data can be used by the input devices for e.g.
 * moving motorized faders to reflect their status on the QLC UI.
