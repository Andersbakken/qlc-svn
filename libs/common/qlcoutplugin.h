/**
 * QLCOutPlugin is an interface for all output plugins. Output plugins provide
 * the means for QLC to actually output DMX data to fixtures, using DMX hard-
 * ware supported by various output plugins.
 *
 * Each plugin can be understood as an adaptation layer betwen QLC and an
 * interconnecting protocol used by a certain family of DMX (well, any
 * lighting protocol) dongles. For example, an FTDI output plugin provides
 * the means for QLC to control fixtures using, for example, an ENTTEC DMX
 * dongles. Each plugin must provide at least one output line for QLC in order
 * to work properly. Then again, if there are no such devices currently
 * connected to the computer that would be supported by the plugin, the plugin
 * can choose to provide no lines at all (until the user plugs in a supported
 * device).
 *
 * When QLC has successfully loaded an input plugin, it will call init()
 * exactly once for each plugin. After that, it is assumed that either the
 * plugin auto-senses the devices it supports or the user must manually try
 * to search for new devices thru a custom configuration dialog that can be
 * opened with configure().
 *
 * Plugins should not leave any resources open unless open() is called. And
 * even then, the plugin should open only such resources that are needed for
 * the specific output line given in the call to open(). Respectively, when
 * close() is called, the plugin should relinquish all resources associated to
 * the closed output line (unless shared with other lines).
 *
 * Plugins have a name that is shown to users as a list item. Each output
 * line name, preceded by its index, is shown under the plugin name as a
 * selectable list entry. Therefore, these names should be descriptive, but
 * relatively short. Output line indices are shown on the UI as 1-based, but
 * they are still handled internally as 0-based.
 *
 * An info text can be fetched for each plugin with infoText(). If the output
 * parameter == KOutputInvalid, the plugin should provide a brief status snippet
 * on its overall state. If the input line parameter is given, the plugin
 * should provide information concerning ONLY that particular output line.
 * This info is displayed to the user as-is.
 *
 * DMX data is written by QLC to plugins with writeData(). Complete 512-channel
 * universes are written at a time. Traffic from output plugins towards QLC is
 * not possible.
