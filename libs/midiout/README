QLC MidiOut Plugin

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This is a simple plugin to convert QLC's internal DMX data into MIDI data.


PROTOCOL
--------
The plugin supports 128 channels used at least in Botex devices, maybe others, 
too. Basically the protocol used by Botex in their MIDI-capable devices is as
follows:

* MIDI channel has nothing to do with DMX channels. You can set any MIDI
  channel for the plugin from 1 to 16, which should be the same as in your
  MIDI-to-<Your equipment here>-device.

* MIDI note NUMBERS from 0 to 127 correspond directly to DMX channels: Note 
  number 0 == DMX channel 0 and MIDI 127 == DMX 127. Actually DMX channels run
  from 1 to 512 which, in QLC means channel numbers 0 thru 511.

* MIDI note VELOCITY sets the intensity for the corresponding channel. Since
  MIDI data is represented only with 7 bits, values from 0 thru 127 are valid.
  The given DMX value is just divided by two so that 255DMX == 127 MIDI;
  127 DMX = 63MIDI.

* MIDI note ON message is sent whenever velocities 1-127 (DMX values 1-255)
  are used and MIDI note OFF message is sent when velocity/value 0 is used.
