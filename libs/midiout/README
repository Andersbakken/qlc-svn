QLC MidiOut Plugin

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This is a simple plugin to convert QLC's internal DMX data into MIDI data.


PROTOCOL
--------
The plugin supports 128 channels used at least in Botex & GLP devices, maybe
others, too. Basically the protocol used by Botex & GLP in their MIDI-capable
devices is as follows:

* MIDI channel has nothing to do with DMX channels. You can set any MIDI
  channel for the plugin from 1 to 16, which should be the same as in your
  MIDI-to-DMX-device (for example GLP DC1224).

* MIDI note NUMBERS from 0 to 127 correspond directly to DMX channels: Note 
  number 0 == DMX channel 1 and MIDI 127 == DMX 128.

* MIDI note VELOCITY sets the intensity for the corresponding channel. Since
  MIDI data is represented only with 7 bits, values from 0 thru 127 are
  available. The given DMX value is just divided by two so that 
  255DMX == 127MIDI, 127DMX = 63MIDI, 0DMX == 0MIDI.

* MIDI note ON message is sent whenever velocities 1-127 (DMX values 1-255)
  are used and MIDI note OFF message is sent when velocity/value 0 is used.
