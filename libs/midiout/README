DESCRIPTION
-----------
This is a simple plugin to convert QLC's internal DMX data into MIDI data.


PROTOCOL
--------
The plugin supports 128 channels thru any MIDI-to-DMX device that operates
on the following protocol description:

* MIDI channel has nothing to do with DMX channels. You can set any MIDI
  channel for the plugin from 1 to 16, which should be the same as in your
  MIDI-to-DMX device (for example GLP DC1224).

* There are two operational modes:

  * Note: MIDI note NUMBERS from 0 to 127 correspond directly to DMX channels:
	C0 = DMX ch 1, C#0 = DMX ch 2 ... G9(127) = DMX ch 128.

	MIDI note VELOCITY sets the intensity for the corresponding channel.
	Since MIDI data is represented only with 7 bits, only values 0-127
	available. The given DMX value is just divided by two so that
	255DMX = 127MIDI, 127DMX = 63MIDI, 0DMX = 0MIDI.

	MIDI note ON message is sent whenever velocities 1-127 (DMX 1-255)
	are used and MIDI note OFF message is sent when velocity/value is 0.

  * Control Change: MIDI controller numbers 0 to 127 correspond directly to
	DMX channels: CC0 = 1, CC1 = 2 ... CC127 = 128.

	The CONTROL VALUE sets the intensity for the corresponding channel.
	Since MIDI data is represented only with 7 bits, only values 0-127
	available. The given DMX value is just divided by two so that
	255DMX = 127MIDI, 127DMX = 63MIDI, 0DMX = 0MIDI.
