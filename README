Requirements
------------
* QT/X11 3.1 or newer
* /dev/rtc (Real-time clock, usually enabled by default)
* Recommended: dmx4linux 2.4


Compiling & Installation
------------------------

You need these components to be able to compile QLC:
* automake >= 1.9
* autoconf >= 2.6
* libtool >= 1.5
* GCC (g++) 3.x
* libstdc++6(.4.x)
* GNU make

See main/docs/compiling.html for more detailed information.
In general, just say

	./bootstrap

and then

        ./configure
	
then
	
	make

as a regular user in the qlc root directory and finally

	make install

(as root) to install QLC (to /usr/local/qlc by default).

If you do not tamper with the Makefiles & config.make too much, a default
and working qlc.rc file should be placed under /etc/



Support & Bug Reports
---------------------
In general, support requests and bug reports should be sent to 
qlc-devel@lists.sf.net.
