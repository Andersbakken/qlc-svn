DEVELOPERS AT WORK
------------------

If you're compiling QLC from sources and you regularly do "svn update" (or
something similar) to get the latest sources, you probably end up seeing some
compiler warnings and errors from time to time. Since the whole source package
is under development, you might even encounter unresolved symbols etc. that
halt the compiler immediately. If such a thing occurs, you should do a "make
distclean" in trunk (top-most source directory) and then "qmake" and "make"
again. We attempt to keep the SVN head free of fatal errors and it should
compile all the time. However, some inter-object dependencies do get mixed up
sometimes and you need to compile the whole package instead of just the latest
changes. Sometimes even that doesn't work, because QLC installs its common
libraries to system directories, where (at least unixes) fetch them instead
of the source directory. In those cases, you might try going to the libs
directory, compile it with "make" and install with "make install" and then
attempt to re-compile the whole package with "make".
