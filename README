Requirements
------------
* QT 3.0 development library (3.0.3)
* Glibc library 2.2.4
* Glibc development library 2.2.4
* X11R6 4.1.0 or higher development library
* /dev/rtc (Real-time clock) enabled from kernel
* optional: dmx4linux 2.2

For TODO-lists, known bugs, volunteering to work for the project and all other
project-related information, go to http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/qlc/



Compiling & Installation
------------------------
See main/docs/compiling.html for more detailed information.
In general, just say

	make

as a regular user in the qlc root directory and then

	make install

(as root) to install QLC (to /usr/local/qlc by default).



To get things finally working...
-----------------------------------------
* QLC must be executed suid root because it needs an interrupt timer from
  /dev/rtc. Normally, a user can get frequencies up to 64Hz from rtc, and
  root can get frequencies from 0-8192Hz. We use a frequency of 1024Hz to
  drive the sequence engine (SequenceProvider) which actually executes all
  functions (crossfades etc.)

  Anyway, saying "chown root.root qlc ; chmod +s qlc" as root will do the
  thing if the install script was unable to do this.

  Another way with 2.4.x kernels is to say

  echo 1024 > /proc/sys/dev/rtc/max-user-freq

* If you do not tamper with the Makefiles & config.make too much, a default
  qlc.rc file should be placed under /etc/


If you wish to participate in the qlc development team
------------------------------------------------------
1. Send mail to hjunnila@users.sourceforge.net
   and tell what you would like to do. A list of open tasks
   is available at http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/qlc/

2. When you have been granted write access to the cvs
   repository, read docs/coding-convention.txt and try
   to follow the rules as much as possible.


I need instructions on...
-------------------------
See qlc2/main/docs/index.html for more documentation. The documentation is
updated every now and then. If there is something that is missing from the
documentation, feel free to ask: hjunnila@users.sourceforge.net
