------------
* QT/X11 3.1.1 or newer
* /dev/rtc (Real-time clock, usually enabled by default)
* Recommended: dmx4linux 2.4



Compiling & Installation
------------------------
See main/docs/compiling.html for more detailed information.
In general, just say

	make

as a regular user in the qlc root directory and then

	make install

(as root) to install QLC (to /usr/local/qlc by default).

If you do not tamper with the Makefiles & config.make too much, a default
and working qlc.rc file should be placed under /etc/

If you want to create KDE/GNOME menu items under Accessories category,
you should type

	make menuitems

Note that this is still a bit experimental and might not work on all
configurations. If it doesn't work, please see below for "Support & Bug Reports".
