Compiling & Installation
------------------------
See main/docs/compiling.html for more detailed information.
In general, just say

	make

as a regular user in the qlc root directory and then

	make install

(as root) to install QLC (to /usr/local/qlc by default).

* If you do not tamper with the Makefiles & config.make too much, a default
  and working qlc.rc file should be placed under /etc/
