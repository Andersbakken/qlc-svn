qlc (3.0.3) stable; urgency=high

qlc (2.6-1) stable; urgency=low

  * Added m_toolbar->setMovingEnabled(false) to all toolbars to prevent
    them from being dragged all over the place.
  * Fixed a bug in pluginmanager.cpp that tried to give an integer
    to a function that actually takes a QString. Since newer QT versions
    contain a QString implementation that accepts also integers, this
    isn't a problem to them. Rather, it's a problem to older QT's

  * Added a preset menu button to console channel

    and then destroyed if parameters were incorrect..
  * Created a bigger application icon (Q.png)

    be hidden from the user.
