	* Christopher Staite: Changed usleep() to nanosleep() in
	  FunctionConsumer.

2007-Oct-24  Heikki Junnila <hjunnila@users.sf.net>
	* Changed VCButton's default name to "" instead of QString::null as
	  an empty string will show up nicer e.g. in its destroy dialog.

	* Started to move from the weird shared menu system in VC
	  to individually-managed menus for each widget.
	* -> TODO: A common base class for VC widgets that contains
	  the shared stuff. BUT the base class MUST NOT inherit QObject
	  because QT doesn't like it. This seems to be quite
	  difficult actually...

	* Created a bigger application icon (Q.png)

2006-Oct-27  Heikki Junnila <hjunnila@users.sf.net>
	* Chaser & collection editors work a bit faster now that the function-
	  manager pops up again after an item has been added. This speeds up
	  inserting multiple steps.

	  complete. Still missing is a capability for reading from the device.
	* Changed the black-out function in app.cpp to send a writeRange()
