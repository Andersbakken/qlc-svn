2006-Oct-15  Heikki Junnila <hjunnila@users.sf.net>
	* Fixed a number of bugs concerning adding, removing and renaming
	  of functions and devices.
	* Now scene editor, function manager and device manager are aware
	  of functions/devices that are added/removed/renamed in another
	  window than their own.

2006-Sep-23  Heikki Junnila <hjunnila@users.sf.net>

	  when it consumed memory even though it was not open nor used.

	  be hidden from the user.

2006-Sep-01  Heikki Junnila <hjunnila@users.sf.net>

	* Changed a double value in app.cpp to t_value (int) to get rid of
	  the compiler warning.
	* Changed newdevice.cpp so that if the user has not touched the
	  name field, it will be filled with the device model. If the user
	  types something, the name is not replaced, unless length == 0.
	* Removed libs/usbdmxout/Makefile.in because it is autogenerated.

2006-Feb-12  Stefan Krumm <stefankrumm@users.sf.net>
	* usb2dmx driver for the Peperoni-Light interfaces should be
	  complete. Still missing is a capability for reading from the device.

	  because sending "0" to individual channels was too slow.
