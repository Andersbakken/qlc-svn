2006-Nov-28  Heikki Junnila <hjunnila@users.sf.net>
	* Fixed a bug in pluginmanager.cpp that tried to give an integer
	  to a function that actually takes a QString. Since newer QT versions
	  contain a QString implementation that accepts also integers, this
	  isn't a problem to them. Rather, it's a problem to older QT's

	* Created a bigger application icon (Q.png)

2006-Oct-27  Heikki Junnila <hjunnila@users.sf.net>
	* Chaser & collection editors work a bit faster now that the function-
	  manager pops up again after an item has been added. This speeds up
	  inserting multiple steps.

	  complete. Still missing is a capability for reading from the device.
	* Changed the black-out function in app.cpp to send a writeRange()
