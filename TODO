This TODO list is not a complete roadmap for QLC. It just contains random
notes and issues found while doing something else. Kind of like a notepad or
something.

* Sanity check for functions and fixtures:
  * After loading, check if all fixtures, channels and member functions
    are present and usable. If not, remove them.
  * When a fixture def is changed for an existing fixture, functions should
    check if their channel & fixture bindings are still valid.
  * After loading and changing fixture def, VC widgets should check if
    their functions, fixtures and channels are still valid.
