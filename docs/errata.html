	<TD BGCOLOR="#EFEFEF">OK, I've added a device to device manager, but when I try to click the <B>monitor</B> or
	<B>dmx console</B> button, nothing happens.</TD>
	<TD BGCOLOR="#EFEFEF">You must first select the device whose <B>monitor</B> or <B>dmx console</> you want to view.</TD>

      <TR>
	<TD BGCOLOR="#EFEFEF">I've assigned a function to a button in virtual console but when I press
	  the button, nothing happens or the function runs slooooowly.</TD>
	<TD BGCOLOR="#EFEFEF">Create a speedslider to virtual console and assign a <B>Speed Bus</B> to it

	<TD BGCOLOR="#EFEFEF">I've built the <B>analoque interface</B>, but QLC cannot control

	<TD BGCOLOR="#EFEFEF">First, run the small script that checks for
					    the necessary <B>kernel modules</B>. If the output on the console seems okay,
					    but the problem persists, check that the parallel port is set

      <TR>
	<TD BGCOLOR="#EFEFEF">I got the message "Unable to save file".</TD>
	<TD BGCOLOR="#EFEFEF">In most cases this means that you don't have write permission

	<TD BGCOLOR="#EFEFEF">I got the message "Unable to access the plugin directory: /foo/bar/blah".</TD>
	<TD BGCOLOR="#EFEFEF">The directory that QLC probes for plugins doesn't exist.
		You can use the program normally with the dummy plugin (no DMX hardware support). If you
		wish to have hardware support, we recommend installing the dmx4linux plugin (that should
		already be installed, by the way...)</TD>
