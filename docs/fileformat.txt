INTRODUCTION
------------
This is a preliminary specification for the general fileformat used in
qlc. The format is based on a "Keyword = Value" principle to keep things
simple and consistent.

Although the file format is the same for workspace files and deviceclass
definition files, these two file types should not be mixed together.

Every new item or section begins with an "Entry" keyword which specifies the
type of data that is expected to follow until the next "Entry" keyword is found.

Each line beginning with a hash "#" (*nix comment line) will be ignored as
well as every line that doesn't contain the equal "=" sign _somewhere_.
Comments that appear on a line with actual data will result in invalid value.

SAMPLE FILE
-----------
# This line will be ignored
Entry = Sample
Data = Value
This line will also be ignored.
AnotherData = AnotherValue
ValidData = InvalidValue #because this comment is on this line

WORKSPACE FILES
---------------
Workspace files have the prefix .qlc to distinguish them from other files.

Entry values recognised by the workspace file parser:

Device		Defines a new device entry
Function 	Defines a new global function entry
Button		Defines a new button widget entry for virtual console
Frame		Defines a new container frame widget entry for virtual console
SpeedSlider	Defines a new speed slider widget entry for virtual console

After the entry line is read, each entry is parsed by an object that is
identified by the Value in the Entry field.

All functions are parsed in two phases: first the functions are created,
without any functionality. Then the file's contents are read again and
the contents are put in place.

DEVICE CLASS FILES
------------------
Device class files have the prefix .deviceclass to distinguish them from other
files.
