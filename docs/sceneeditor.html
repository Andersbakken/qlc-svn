<H1>Scene Editor</H1>
<P>
The scene editor, as its name suggests, is used to edit
<A HREF="concept.html#Scene">scene</A> functions. The editor is divided into
tabs; with the first, <B>General</B> tab, you control the fixtures that take
part in the scene, the scene's name and the <A HREF="concept.html#Buses">bus</A>
that controls the scene's fade time. All subsequent tabs are used to control
the individual channel values for each fixture.
</P>

<H2>General Tab Controls</H2>

<P>
<B>Note:</B> The toolbar on top of the window is disabled completely while the
<B>General</B> tab is visible.

<H2>Fixture Tabs</H2>

<P>
Each fixture is represented by its own tab that contains sliders for each of
the fixture's channels. Each channel can be enabled or disabled with a check
box on top of the channel unit. The value of each channel can be set either by
typing the value to the edit box on top of the slider or by moving the slider.
Channels that provide multiple functions such as gobos, colors, etc. have also
a button above the channel slider; this button can be used to directly select
a specific function or capability provided by that channel.
</P>

<H3>Channel enabled/disabled status</H3>

<P>
If a channel has not been enabled, the scene will not touch that particular
channel's value ever.
</P>

<P>
If a channel has been enabled, the scene will change that channel's value to a
value defined in the scene. This is useful, for example, when you wish to
control only the dimmer channel of a scanner fixture; you wouldn't want the
scene to touch the scanner's pan, tilt, colour or gobo channels when you just
want to fade in or fade out with the dimmer channel.
</P>
