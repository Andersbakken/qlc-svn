<H1>Coding Convention</H1>
</CENTER>

<P>
This file describes the coding convention (ten commandments) used in QLC
source code. The purpose of this document is to instruct developers to write
somewhat uniform code. The following rules are more or less similar to the
<A HREF="http://doc.trolltech.com/qq/qq13-apis.html">Qt coding convention</A>.
Please read that page first. It's REALLY good.
</P>

<HR>

<P>
1. Each source file should be attached with this header:<BR>
<PRE>

</PRE>
</P>

<HR>

<P>
2. Each member variable has a prefix "m_", for example:<BR>
<PRE>
	int m_fooMember;
</PRE>
Each global variable or function begins with "_", for example:
<PRE>
	int _foo;
</PRE>

<B>Still, try to avoid global variables at all costs!</B>
</P>

<HR>

<P>
3. Each function begins with a small letter and in compound words, all
the following words begin with a capital letter. No word separation with
underscore is allowed. Examples:
<PRE>
int foo();
int fooBar();
int thisIsAMemberFunction();
int this_is_not_allowed_because_it_is_ugly;
</PRE>
</P>

<HR>

<P>
4. Every control structure (if, while, for...) will be written inside
brackets { } even if they would contain only one line of code, unless it looks
really nice and clean. Also, brackets are written on their own line without
anything else after or before the bracket on the same line. This goes for
function and class definitions, too:
<PRE>
do
{
    foo();
}
while (bar);

if (foo == true)
{
    foo();
}
else
{
    bar();
}

for (int i = 0; i != n; i++)
{
    foo(i);
}

void FooClass::fooBar()
{
    ...
}
</PRE>
</P>

<HR>

<P>
5. Each class name will be written each word beginning with a capital letter.
Same rules as with functions.
<PRE>
class FooBar;
class Foo;
</PRE>
</P>

<P>
5.1. Respectively, each class should be in its own file and the file name must be
the class' name, in small letters. If it makes things significantly more logical,
SMALL classes can be defined inside other classes' definitions and files.
File suffix for implementation files is ".cpp" and for header files ".h". Do NOT
use other styles.<BR>
In general:<BR>
class FooBarClass definition is saved in foobarclass.h<BR>
and its implementation is in foobarclass.cpp
</P>

<HR>

<P>
6. All macro definitions are written completely in capital letters, words
may be separated with "_". Example:

<PRE>
#define FOOBAR 5
#define FOO_BAR(x) foobar(x);
</PRE>
</P>

<P>
6.1 Normal integer macros, like the ones you would use to identify certain menu
items, columns etc. can be substituted with static constants, in which case, the
constant's name begins with a capital 'K'. This is done to associate them more
into the field of #defined macros than variables.<BR>
<PRE>
static const int KMenuItem ( 1000 );
</PRE>
</P>

<HR>

<P>
7. Each operator will be separated with spaces:
<PRE>
if (foo == bar)

while (foo != bar)

int foo = bar;

for (int foo = 0; foo != bar; foo++)
...
</PRE>
</P>

<HR>

<P>
8. Variable, function and class names should be descriptive. Use your common
sense here.
</P>

<HR>

<P>
9. Write nice and readable code. Do not write code in one pile, use spaces and
empty lines between logical sections.
</P>

<HR>

<P>
10. WRITE COMMENTS.
