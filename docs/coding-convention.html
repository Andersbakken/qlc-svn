    <H1>Q Light Controller 2 Coding Convention</H1>
    
    <P CLASS="normal">
      This file describes the coding convention used in qlc source code.<BR>
      The purpose of this document is to instruct developers to write somewhat<BR>
      uniform code. The following rules are more or less similar to Qt's coding<BR>
      convention.
    </P>

    <P CLASS="normal">
      1. Each source file should be attached with this header:
      <PRE>

      2. Each member variable has a prefix "m_", for example int m_fooMember;<BR>
	Each global variable or function begins with "_", for example int _foo;
    </P>
    
    <P CLASS="normal">
      3. Each function begins with a small letter and in compound words, all
      the following words begin with a capital letter. No word separation with
      "_" is allowed. Examples:
      <PRE>
   int foo();
   int fooBar();
   int thisIsAMemberFunction();
   int this_is_not_allowed_because_it_is_ugly_and_differs_from_Qt_convention();
      </PRE>
    </P>
    
    <P CLASS="normal">
      4. Every control structure (if, while, for...) will be written inside
      brackets { } even if they would contain only one line of code.
      Also, the brackets are written on a new line without anything
      else after the bracket. This goes for functions, too:
      <PRE>
   do
   {
	foo();
   }
   while (bar);

   if (foo == true)
   {
	foo();
   }
   else
   {
	bar();
   }

   for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
   {
	foo(i);
   }

   void FooClass::fooBar()
   {
	...
   }
      </PRE>
    </P>
    
    <P CLASS="normal">
      5. Each class name will be written each word beginning with a capital letter:
      <PRE>
   class FooBar;
   class Foo;
      </PRE>
    </P>

    <P CLASS="normal">
      5.1. Respectively, each class should be in its own file and the file name must be<BR>
	the class' name, in small letters. If it makes things significantly more logical,<BR>
	classes can be defined inside other classes' definitions and files. File suffix for<BR>
	implementation files is ".cpp" and for header files ".h". Do NOT use other styles.<BR>
	In general:<BR>
	  <PRE>
   class FooBarClass definition is saved in foobarclass.h
     and its implementation is in foobarclass.cpp
          </PRE>
    
    <P CLASS="normal">
      6. All macro definitions are written completely in capital letters, words
      may be separated with "_". Example:
    <PRE>
      #define FOOBAR 5
      #define FOO_BAR(x) foobar(x);
    </PRE>
    </P>
    
    <P CLASS="normal">
      7. Each operator will be separated with spaces:
      <PRE>
   if (foo == bar)
   while ( foo != bar)
   int foo = bar;
      </PRE>
    </P>
    
    <P CLASS="normal">
      8. Variable, function and class names should be descriptive. Use your common
      sense here.
    </P>

    <P CLASS="normal">
      9. Do not write code in one pile, use spaces and empty lines between
      logical sections.
    </P>

    <P CLASS="normal">
      10. Write nice and readable code.
    </P>

    <P CLASS="normal">
      11. WRITE COMMENTS. I am a BAD example on this...
    </P>
