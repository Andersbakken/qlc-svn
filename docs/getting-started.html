<H1>Getting Started</H1>

<H3>Starting QLC</H3>
<P>
<LI>Start qlc from the desktop menu or from a terminal with the command:</LI>
<PRE>
	qlc
</PRE>
</P>

<P>
After some messages the main window will open. If there are any errors, refer to
<A HREF="errata.html" CLASS="link">Errata</A> and <A HREF="faq.html" CLASS="link">FAQ</A>.
</P>

<H3>Main Window</H3>
<IMG SRC="pics/mainwindow.png" ALT="Main Window">

<P>
Most controls throughout the software have tooltips, which pop up after holding your mouse button
over a control item (button, slider etc.) for a while. The menubar on the top of the workspace window
contains vital operations which we will discuss a bit later. Below the menubar is the toolbar that
contains the following buttons (from left to right): <B>new</B>, <B>open</B>, <B>save</B>,
<B>device manager</B>, <B>virtual console</B>, <B>function manager</B>, <B>panic</B>, <B>blackout</B>
and <B>mode change</B>.
</P>

<P>
Notice also the status bar at the bottom of the window. There are the indicators for mode and blackout.
The mode indicator says "Design" which means that the application is in design (edit) mode. The blackout
indicator is not visible, but when you click the blackout button on the toolbar, the indicator starts
flashing to notify that all channels are disabled and their values are set to zero (until you release
the blackout by pressing the button once more).
</P>

<H3>Device Manager</H3>
<P>
The device manager is the heart of qlc's device-oriented architecture. As its name already says, you
manage your DMX devices (i.e. fixtures) from the device manager.
</P>

<LI>Open the device manager now by pressing its button on the toolbar.</LI>

<P>
<IMG SRC="pics/devicemanager.png" ALT="Device Manager">
</P>

<P>
The device manager also has a toolbar, containing the following buttons (from left to right):
<B>Add</B>, <B>Clone</B>, <B>Remove</B>, <B>Properties</B>, <B>Monitor</B> and <B>Console</B>. In short,
you can <B>add</B> new devices, create exact replicas <B>clones</B> of existing devices and their
functions, edit the <B>properties</B> of your devices, <B>monitor</B> the devices' channel values and
use the <B>console</B> to control the channel values of each device.
</P>

<LI>Add an input device (press the first button from left) to our workspace. You should see a the
following dialog:</LI>

<H3>New Device</H3>
<IMG SRC="pics/newdevice.png" ALT="Add new device dialog">

<P>
On the left side you can see the list of available fixture manufacturers. Each manufacturer folder
contains a number of fixtures produced by each manufacturer. You can find for example an "MX-4"
under "Martin" folder. As you click a fixture from the list, you can see the <B>channels</B>
field on the right change to display the number of DMX channels required by the selected fixture.
</P>

<LI>Go ahead and select Martin MX-4 but don't click OK just yet.</LI>

<P>
You can edit the new device's name in the <B>Name</B> field and its DMX address
to the <B>Address</B> field. If you don't understand the DMX addressing principles,
please consult your lighting equipment manuals for more info.
</P>

      <P>
	In the left pane you can see the devices that are present in your current
	workspace. In the right pane, you can see the currently selected device's
	information.
      </P>
