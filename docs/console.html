<P>
The console is the lowest-level of control in QLC that you can have over a fixture. The left side of
the console is reserved for a very powerful scene editor while the right side contains sliders for
each channel in the selected fixture.
</P>

<H3>Scene Editor</H3>
<P>
The scene editor consists of a menu button and a list of scenes created for the selected device.
Clicking the menu button (or right mouse button on a scene name) displays a popup menu from which
you can add/remove/edit the scenes. There is also a save status indicator below the scene list, which
tells you whether you have modified the current scene (and need to create a new scene or overwrite an
existing scene).
</P>

<H3>Scene Editor Menu Items</H3>

<UL>
<P>
<B>Activate selected:</B> Activate the selected scene (instantly sets the scene values and sliders).<BR>
<B>Create New:</B> Create a new scene using the current slider values<BR>
<B>Overwrite:</B> Save current slider values to the selected scene<BR>
<B>Remove selected:</B> Remove the selected scene from the device.<BR>
<B>Rename selected:</B> Rename the selected scene
</P>
</UL>

<H3>Console Sliders</H3>

<P>
Each channel occupied by the selected device has its own slider in the console. Moving any one of
the sliders will immediately set the channel value to DMX hardware (if any) unless blackout is
enabled. Below each slider, there is a button, that has three states:
</P>

<UL>
<P>
<B>F</B>ade: The value is treated as a "fade" value in scenes<BR>
<B>S</B>et: The value is treated as a "set" value in scenes<BR>
<B>X</B> (NoSet): The channel value is not used in scenes
</P>
</UL>

You can read more about the states from the <A HREF="concept.html#Scene">QLC Concept page</A>.

<H3>Console Slider Menus</H3>

<P>
Clicking the right mouse button over a console slider opens a popup menu from which you can select
different capabilities (presets) defined for each channel (ex. Gobo or Color selection).
</P>

<H2>Closing</H2>

<P>
To close the window just click the <B>close</B> button in the upper-right corner of the window.
