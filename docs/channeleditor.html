<H1>Channel Editor</H1>
<P>
The Channel Editor is used to edit individual channels and the value ranges of
each capability (a green colour, a certain gobo, prism rotation, etc..) that a
fixture channel provides. Refer to your fixture's manual to get a detailed
list of the fixture's channels and values.

  <TD>
   The channel group. The group names are usually rather self-explanatory and
   are used mainly for showing a correct icon and colour in <A HREF="sceneeditor.html">Scene Editor</A>, but
   there are also some advanced features related to channel groups:
   <LI><B>Intensity:</B> By default, QLC's <A HREF="concept.html#GrandMaster">Grand Master</A>
   controls only Intensity channels. Note also when you create RGB/CMY channels,
   that they should be assigned to the <I>Intensity</I> group, NOT the <EM STYLE="text-decoration:line-through;">Colour</EM> group.</LI>
   <LI><B>Intensity:</B> The Colour Tool in <A HREF="sceneeditor.html">Scene Editor</A>
   is available if a fixture provides channels named <U>"Red", "Green" and "Blue"</U>
   and/or <U>"Cyan", "Magenta" and "Yellow"</U>, belonging to the <I>Intensity</I> group.</LI>
   <LI><B>Colour:</B> If a <A HREF="concept.html#Capabilities">capability</A> name contains the keyword <U>rainbow</U>
   in a channel that belongs to the <I>Colour</I> group, that capability will
   have a rainbow icon beside it in <A HREF="sceneeditor.html">Scene Editor</A>
   and <A HREF="fixturemanager.html">fixture console</A>.</LI>
   <LI><B>Pan/Tilt:</B> <A HREF="concept.html#EFX">EFX</A> and
   <A HREF="vcxypad.html">XY Pad</A> are able to control a fixture only if it
   has <U>Pan and Tilt</U> channels (8bit or 16bit).</LI>
  </TD>
 </TR>
 <TR>
  <TD>
   <B>Control Byte</B>
  </TD>
  <TD>
   This feature is available only for <U>Pan and Tilt</U> channels. If a fixture
   has only one pan and one tilt channel, assign them both the <B>Coarse (MSB)</B>
   control byte. If a fixture has two pan and two tilt channels, assign the
   <B>Fine (LSB)</B> byte to those pan/tilt channels that provide only subtle
   (fine 16bit) movement.
  </TD>
 </TR>
 <TR>
  <TD>
   <B>Capability list</B>
  </TD>
  <TD>
   Shows you a list of value ranges for the currently edited channel. If a
   channel provides only one capability (for example pan or dimmer) the only
   thing needed in the list is one capability with a range of 0 to 255.
   For more elaborate capabilities, such as colours or gobos, you should create
   capability ranges for each of the colours (for example 0-15 white, 16-32 blue...)
