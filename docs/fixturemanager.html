<H1>Fixture Manager</H1>
<P>
The fixture manager is the heart of QLC's fixture-oriented architecture. As
its name already says, you can manage  (add, remove and edit) your lighting
fixtures from the fixture manager. On the left side of the manager there is a
list that displays all of the fixtures in the current workspace. The right side
of the window displays some important details on the currently selected fixture.
</P>
<P>
Each fixture can also be controlled directly with its dedicated console on the
<B>Console</B> tab. However, since this console is very limited in functionality,
it is meant only for the simplest of tasks. For everything more complex than
casual testing or one-time level adjustment you should use
<A HREF="concept.html#Functions">Functions</A> coupled to
<A HREF="concept.html#VirtualConsole">Virtual Console</A> controls.
