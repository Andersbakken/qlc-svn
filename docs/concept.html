<H1>Basic Concepts & Glossary</H1>

<P>
Q Light Controller (QLC for short) is meant to control lighting equipment used
in various performances, like live concerts and theatres etc. The main purpose
is that QLC could outperform commercial lighting desks with an intuitive and
flexible user interface, without the need for a 500+ page manual.
</P>

<P>
This page has been arranged in alphabetical order to ease searching for a
specific topic.
</P>

<A NAME="Blackout" HREF="#Blackout"><H3>Blackout</H3></A>

<P>
Blackout is used to set all channels in all universes to zero and keep them
that way, regardless of what functions are currently being run or what values
have been set to them manually. When blackout is turned off, <U>current
values</U> of all channels are set to each universe.
</P>

<A NAME="Buses" HREF="#Buses"><H3>Buses</H3></A>

<P>
Buses provide different speed settings to the various <A HREF="#Functions">
functions</A> that the user creates. One bus may control the <I>fading</i>
speed for a group of scenes, another the time it takes for an <A HREF="#EFX">
EFX</A> function to complete a full circle, etc..
</P>

<P>
Functions have speed buses that are set by users. A maximum of 32 different
speed settings called buses, are possible. One function can have exactly one
bus and many functions can share one bus. The speed setting of each bus can be
changed at any time with a resolution of 1/64th of second. Any of the buses can
be assigned in <A HREF="#Modes">design mode</A> to any function. The only
exception to this comes from <A HREF="#Collection">collection</A> functions,
which don't have a speed setting at all.
</P>

<P>
Each bus can have a name set by the user can for convenience and to help in
identification. The name of the first bus is, by default, "Fade" and it is
assigned to all newly-created functions.
</P>

<P>
Buses can also send special "tap" signals, that can be used, for example, to
manually synchronize chaser stepping to match tempo.
</P>

<A NAME="Chaser" HREF="#Chaser"><H3>Chaser</H3></A>

<P>
A chaser <A HREF="#Functions">function</A> encapsulates multiple scenes that are
run in serial, one after the other, when the chaser function is started. The
next function is run only after the previous has finished. Any number of
<A HREF="#Scene">scenes</A> can be inserted to a chaser.
</P>

<P>
Chaser functions' direction can be reversed. The function can also be set to do
an infinite loop, an infinite ping-pong-loop (direction is reversed after
each pass) or it can run thru just once, in a single-shot mode, after which it
terminates by itself. If the function is set to do an infinite loop, it must
be stopped manually.
</P>

<P>
<A HREF="#Buses">Bus</A> number 2 (Default Hold) is assigned to all
newly-created chasers by default. The bus value specifies step duration for
chasers. If the speed setting of a chaser's members scene is higher (slower)
than the chaser's speed setting, the scene won't have enough time to fade to
its target value before the chaser triggers the next step. Respectively, if
a member scene's speed setting is lower (faster) than the chaser's speed
setting, the chaser will wait after the scene has finished before it triggers
the next step.
</P>

<P>
Copies of chaser functions can be created within the 4096 total function limit.
All of the function's contents are copied to the duplicate. After copying, the
two functions are completely independent entities that behave exactly the same.
For chasers, only information on the member scenes get copied. The member
scenes themselves are not copied.
</P>

<A NAME="Collection" HREF="#Collection"><H3>Collection</H3></A>

<P>
A collection <A HREF="#Functions">function</A> encapsulates multiple functions
that are run simultaneously when the collection function is executed. Any number
of functions can be inserted to a collection, but each function can be inserted
only once and a collection cannot be a direct member of itself.
</P>

<P>
<A HREF="#Buses">Speed setting</A> has no effect on collections. Each member
function's speed is set individually thru their own buses.
</P>

<P>
Copies of collection functions can be created within the 4096 total function
limit. All of the function's contents are copied to the duplicate. After
copying, the two functions are completely independent entities that behave
exactly the same. For collections, only information on the member functions get
copied. The member functions themselves are not copied.
</P>

<A NAME="DMX" HREF="#DMX"><H3>DMX</H3></A>

<P>
DMX is short for <B>D</B>igital <B>M</B>ultiple<B>X</B>. It basically defines
a whole bunch of properties, protocol, wiring etc. but in the case of a lighting
software, it defines the maximum number of channels (512) per universe and the
channels' value range (0-255).
</P>

<P>
QLC supports 4 individual universes, that need not be necessarily connected to
DMX hardware; rather, DMX has just been selected as the de facto lighting
standard. Actual hardware abstraction (whether it's analog 0-10V, DMX or some
other method) is achieved thru <A HREF="#OutputPlugins">output plugins</A>.
</P>

<A NAME="EFX" HREF="#EFX"><H3>EFX</H3></A>

<P>
An EFX <A HREF="#Functions">function</A> is mainly used to automate moving
lights (e.g. scanners & moving heads). The EFX can create complex mathematical
paths on an X-Y plane that are converted to DMX values for the fixture's pan and
tilt channels. <B>Only fixtures that contain valid pan & tilt channels can take
part in an EFX function.</B>
</P>

<P>
<A HREF="#Buses">Bus</A> number 1 (Default Fade) is assigned to all newly
created EFX's by default. The bus value is used as the overall time for the EFX
algorithm to complete one cycle. In other words, with a circle algorithm, the
bus value is understood as the time available to complete a full 360 degree
circle.
</P>

<P>
EFX functions can have special start and stop <A HREF="#Scene">scenes</A>, that
are run just before the EFX is started and immediately after the EFX stops.
These scenes are not, however, faded as would happen with a normal scene.
Instead, their values are set immediately, as if their speed setting was zero.
</P>

<P>
Fixtures taking part in an EFX function can be set to follow the algorithm
either in parallel or serial:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Parallel: all fixtures follow the same pattern synchronously</LI>
<LI>Serial: fixtures start following the pattern one after the other, with a
little in-between delay, creating a more lively, wave-like effect. To see the
effect, you need at least two similar moving fixtures, preferably four.</LI>
</UL>


<P>
EFX functions' direction can be reversed for all fixtures at once or on a
per-fixture basis. The function can also be set to do an infinte loop, an
infinite ping-pong-loop (direction is reversed after each pass) or it can run
thru just once, in a single-shot mode, after which it terminates by itself.
If the function is set to do an infinite loop, it must be stopped manually.
</P>

<P>
Copies of EFX functions can be created within the 4096 total function limit.
All of the function's contents are copied to the duplicate. After copying, the
two functions are completely independent entities that behave exactly the same.
</P>

<A NAME="Fixtures" HREF="#Fixtures"><H3>Fixtures</H3></A>

<P>
A fixture is essentially one lighting device. It can be, for example, one
moving head, one scanner, one laser etc.. However, for simplicity, individual
PAR cans (and the like) that are usually controlled thru one dimmer channel per
can, can be grouped together to form one single fixture.
</P>

<P>
Users can store shared fixture information in a fixture library that contains
the following properties for each fixture:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Manufacturer (e.g. Martin)</LI>
<LI>Model (e.g. MAC250)</LI>
<LI>Type (Color Changer, Scanner, Moving Head, Smoke, Haze, Fan...)</LI>
<LI>Physical properties (bulb type, beam angle, dimensions...)</LI>
<LI>Channels:
<UL>
 <LI>Channel group (Pan, Tilt, Gobo, Color, Speed etc.)</LI>
 <LI>8bit and 16bit channel bindings for pan & tilt groups</LI>
 <LI>Value ranges for channel features (e.g. 0-5:Lamp on, 6-15:Strobe etc..)</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
</UL>


<P>
These fixture entries can then be used to create fixture instances (256 at most
at a time), that will, after instantiation, have additional properties defined
by users:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>DMX Universe</LI>
<LI>DMX Address</LI>
<LI>Name</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Several instances of a fixture can be created (i.e. users must be able to
have several instances of a MAC250 in use). Each fixture can be named, but the
name is not used internally to identify individual fixture instances. The same
goes for the DMX address. Nevertheless users are encouraged to name their
fixtures in some systematic way to help identify each of them -- if necessary.
</P>

<P>
Generic dimmer devices don't need their own fixture definitions, because usually
multiple dimmers are patched into a common address space, employing one or more
dimmers. Users can create instances of these generic dimmer entities just by
defining the number of channels each one of them should use.
</P>

<A NAME="FixtureMode" HREF="#FixtureMode"><H3>Fixture Mode</H3></A>

<P>
Many manufacturers design their intelligent lights in such a way that they can
be configured to understand different sets of channels. For example, a scanner
might have two configuration options: one for only 8bit movement channels
(1x pan, 1x tilt) and another one for 16bit movement channels (2x pan, 2x tilt).
Instead of creating a completely new fixture definition for each variation,
they have been bundled together in QLC's fixture definitions into fixture modes.
</P>

<A NAME="Functions" HREF="#Functions"><H3>Functions</H3></A>

<P>
Users can create 4096 functions, that are used to automate the setting of
values to channels. Each function type has its own way for automating lights.
</P>

<P>
The function types are:
</P>
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="#Scene">Scene</A></LI>
<LI><A HREF="#Chaser">Chaser</A></LI>
<LI><A HREF="#EFX">EFX</A></LI>
<LI><A HREF="#Collection">Collection</A></LI>
</UL>

<P>
Each function can be named, but the name is not used internally to identify
individual functions. Nevertheless users are encouraged to name their functions
in some systematic way to help identify each of them -- if necessary.
</P>

<A NAME="GrandMaster" HREF="#GrandMaster"><H3>Grand Master</H3></A>

<P>
The Grand Master is used as the final master slider before values are written
to the actual physical DMX hardware. Usually, the Grand Master affects only
<B>Intensity</B> channels, but can be also changed to have effect on the values
of <B>all</B> channels.
</P>

<P>
The Grand Master has also two <B>Value Modes</B> that control the way <I>how</I>
the Grand Master affects channel values passing through:
<UL>
<LI><B>Reduce:</B> Affected channels' values are reduced by a percentage set with the
Grand Master slider. For example, Grand Master at 50% will result in all
affected channels being reduced to 50% of their current values.</LI>
<LI><B>Limit:</B> Affected channels cannot get larger values than directly set with
the Grand Master slider. For example, Grand Master at 127 will result in all
affected channel's maximum values being limited at exactly 127.</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<A NAME="InputPlugins" HREF="#InputPlugins"><H3>Input plugins</H3></A>

<P>
Primary input methods for QLC are naturally the keyboard and mouse. Users can
attach keyboard keys to virtual console buttons and drag sliders and do pretty
much everything with a mouse. It is possible to attach additional input devices
to one's computer to alleviate the rather clumsy and slow user experience that
is achieved with a regular mouse and a keyboard. Special input plugins provide
capabilities for getting external devices (mainly slider boards) to produce
input data to various QLC elements.
</P>

<A NAME="Input" HREF="#Input"><H3>Input (line)</H3></A>

<P>
An input is a physical input line provided by some hardware which is accessed
thru an input plugin. It can be, for example, a MIDI IN connector in the user's
computer (or peripheral) to which users can connect MIDI-capable input devices
like slider boards etc.
</P>

<A NAME="InputDevices" HREF="#InputDevices"><H3>Input devices</H3></A>

<P>
Input devices can be thought of as <A HREF="#Fixtures">fixtures'</A> cousins;
they contain information on specific devices that produce input data for the
users. An input device can be, for example, a specific slider board like the
Behringer BCF-2000.
</P>

<A NAME="Modes" HREF="#Modes"><H3>Modes</H3></A>

<P>
Q Light Controller is based on the common concept of having two distinct
operational modes to prevent accidental or otherwise harmful changes during
operation:
</P>
<UL>
<LI><U>Design mode</U> is meant to edit the behaviour of the program;
create and edit <A HREF="#Functions">functions</A> and
<A HREF="#Fixtures">fixtures</A> and how they work.</LI>
<LI><U>Operate mode</U> is meant to execute the created functions that
eventually control the user's lighting fixtures.</LI>
</UL>

<A NAME="Output" HREF="#OutputPlugins"><H3>Output plugins</H3></A>

<P>
DMX output is achieved thru output plugins that can support one or more
output lines. It is also possible to run QLC without actual DMX
hardware.
</P>

<A NAME="Output" HREF="#Output"><H3>Output (line)</H3></A>

<P>
An output is a physical output line provided by some hardware which is accessed
thru an output plugin. In other words, it is a real DMX universe, but has been
dubbed <u>output</u> to separate it from QLC's internal universes. You could
think of them as individual output (XLR) connectors in your DMX hardware.
</P>

<A NAME="Scene" HREF="#Scene"><H3>Scene</H3></A>

<P>
A scene <A HREF="#Functions">function</A> encapsulates the values of selected
channels owned by one or more fixture instances. When a scene is started, the
duration it takes for its channels to reach their target values depends on the
function's <A HREF="#Buses">speed setting</A>. Bus number 1 (Default Fade) is
assigned to all newly created scenes by default. If the bus' value is 0 seconds,
the scene values are set immediately and no fading occurs. Otherwise the values
are always faded from what they currently are, to the target values defined in
the scene. Channels that are not enabled in the scene will not be touched at
all by the function.
</P>

<P>
Copies of scene functions can be created within the 4096 total function limit.
All of the function's contents are copied to the duplicate. After copying, the
two functions are completely independent entities that behave exactly the same.
</P>

<A NAME="VirtualConsole" HREF="#VirtualConsole"><H3>Virtual Console</H3></A>

<P>
The purpose of the virtual console is to act as an open sandbox where the user
can create a lighting desk layout of his choice. Users can create various GUI
(Graphical User Interface) elements, called widgets, onto the console surface:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Buttons for starting and stopping functions</LI>
<LI>Sliders for adjusting selected bus or channel values</LI>
<LI>XY Pads for manually moving intelligent light beams</LI>
<LI>Cue lists for theatrical performance purposes</LI>
<LI>Frames for grouping various widgets together</LI>
<LI>Labels to act as static information banners for other widgets</LI>
</UL>
