Purpose
</P>

<P CLASS="normal">
Q Light Controller (QLC for short) is meant to control lighting equipment used 
in various performances, like live concerts and theatres etc. The main purpose is that
QLC could outperform commercial lighting desks with an intuitive user interface and more
flexible user interface.
</P>

<P CLASS="subtitle">
Modes
</P>

<P CLASS="normal">
Q Light Controller is based on the concept of having two distinct operational modes to prevent 
accidental or otherwise harmful changes during operation. Design mode is meant to edit the behaviour
of the program; create and edit functions and devices and how they are operated. Operate mode is meant
to execute the created functions that actually automate lighting controls.
</P>

<P CLASS="subtitle">
Devices
</P>

<P CLASS="normal">
The software is based on the DMX512 standard which defines the number of universes, number of 
channels and value range for all channels, as well as other protocol-related information. QLC 
will support the use of one DMX universe, consisting of 512 channels, each channel having an integer 
value between 0 and 255. DMX access is achieved thru the DMX4Linux driver suite. Additional protocols 
can be supported thru custom made plugins. It must be possible to run QLC without actual DMX hardware 
for offline editing.
</P>

<P CLASS="normal">
The user can store shared device information in a device class library that contains the following
properties on each device class:
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
* Manufacturer and model (e.g. Manufacturer:Martin, Model:MAC550).
<BR>
* Type (Dimmer, Color changer, Scanner, Moving head, Fogger, Hazer, Fan, Other)
<BR>
* Number of channels (1-512).
<BR>
* Description of each channel's purpose (e.g. Gobo, Color, Speed etc.)
<BR>
* Value ranges in each channel representing a special functionality (e.g. 0-1:Lamp on)
<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="normal">
These device class entries can then be used to create device instances (256 at most at a time), 
that will, after instantiation, have additional properties defined by the user:
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
* DMX Address
<BR>
* Name
<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="normal">
Although each device can be named, the name must not be used internally to discern device instances
from one another. The same goes for the DMX address. Several instances of one device class can be
created and one device can be an instance of exactly one device class.
</P>

<P CLASS="subtitle">
Functions
</P>

<P CLASS="normal">
The user can create a number of functions, that are used to automate the setting of values to channels. 
The four different function types are: scene, chaser, collection and sequence. Each function can be 
named, but the name must not be used internally to discern one function from another, although it is 
encouraged that the user gives functions descriptive names.
</P>

<P CLASS="normal">
<B>Speed Setting</B>
</P>

<P CLASS="normal">
Functions have a speed setting that is set by the user. A maximum of 32 different speed settings called 
buses, are possible. One function can have exactly one bus and many functions can share a bus. The speed 
settings can be changed at any time and can be between 0 and 10 seconds with a resolution of at least 
25 milliseconds. Any of the buses can be assigned in design mode to any function. A name can be assigned 
to each of the buses, for convenience and clarity.
</P>

<P CLASS="normal">
The names of the first two buses are fixed to "Default Fade" and "Default Hold", respectively.
Functions completion times and their run-time accuracy in value setting can be late or early 10 
milliseconds on average. The user must be able to quickly (<100ms) stop all running functions in case
something disastrous happens.
</P>

<P CLASS="normal">
<B>Scene</B>
</P>

<P CLASS="normal">
A scene function encapsulates the values of all channels held by one device instance. Each stored value 
holds information on the style that the value will be set once the scene function is activated. Possible 
value types (styles) are:
<BR>
&nbsp;
</BR>
* Fade
<BR>
* Set
<BR>
* NoSet
<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="normal">
Of these, "NoSet" means that the value of the channel must not be touched at all. "Set" value is set at 
the very instant when the function is executed. "Fade" value is namely faded from the value that the 
channel currently has, to the value specified in the scene, smoothly during the given time span (e.g. 
speed bus value). The execution of a scene takes always the time specified as the function's speed, 
regardless of whether the channel values are already those specified in the scene or all values are of 
type "Set" or "NoSet".
</P>

<P CLASS="normal">
Bus number 1 (Default Fade) is assigned to all newly created scenes by default.
</P>

<P CLASS="normal">
A copy of a scene function can be created to the same device that the original is assigned to, or to 
another device. All scene properties are copied to the duplicated scene. If the target device has less 
channels than the originating device, excess channels are cropped from the copy. If the target device 
has more channels than the originating device, the extra channels are set to zero value with "NoSet" 
type. After copying, the two functions are completely independent function entities. Scenes can also be 
moved between devices with the same rules.
</P>

<P CLASS="normal">
<B>Collection</B>
</P>

<P CLASS="normal">
A collection function encapsulates multiple functions that are executed simultaneously when the 
collection function is executed. Any number of functions can be inserted to a collection. One function 
can be inserted only once and a collection cannot be a member of itself. The collection function is not 
attached to a device, thus it is held in the Global function space.
</P>

<P CLASS="normal">
The speed setting has no effect on a collection, therefore, it is not necessary to have the possibility 
to assign a bus to a collection.
</P>

<P CLASS="normal">
A copy of a collection function can be created to the global function space. The duplicated function has 
the same properties as the original function. After copying, the two functions are completely 
independent function entities.
</P>

<P CLASS="normal">
<B>Chaser</B>
</P>

<P CLASS="normal">
A chaser function encapsulates multiple functions that are executed in serial one after another when 
the chaser function is executed. The next function is executed after the previous has stopped. Any 
number of functions can be inserted to a chaser. The chaser cannot be a member of itself.
</P>

<P CLASS="normal">
A chaser's direction can be set to (mutually exclusive):
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
* Normal (traverse the functions from the beginning to the end)
<BR>
* Reverse (traverse the functions from the end to the beginning)
</P>

<P CLASS="normal">
The run order can be set to (mutually exclusive):
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
* Loop (loop indefinitely, jump to the first after executing the last function)
<BR>
* Single-shot (traverse the functions thru once and stop)
<BR>
* Ping-Pong (loop indefinitely, but reverse the direction at both ends)
<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="normal">
The direction setting affects run order as described.
</P>

<P CLASS="normal">
Speed setting is used to set a hold time between functions that must elapse, before the next function 
is executed. Bus number 2 (Default Hold) is assigned to all newly created scenes by default.
</P>

<P CLASS="normal">
A copy of a chaser function can be created to the global function space. The duplicated function has 
the same properties as the original function. After copying, the two functions are completely 
independent function entities.
</P>

<P CLASS="subtitle">
Virtual Console
</P>

<P CLASS="normal">
The virtual console is essentially a "drawing area", that is initially empty. The user can add and 
remove buttons, sliders, frames and labels that are used to construct a custom lighting console. The 
lighting automation is primarily controlled thru the virtual console, although limited control is also 
possible thru the device console.
</P>

<P CLASS="normal">
The virtual console background can be a color or a tiled image. The user can restrict the movement and 
sizes of the GUI elements (widgets) as if they were on a grid. The grid can have a resolution between 
1-100 pixels independently for x- and y-axes and the grid can be turned on or off. If the grid is 
turned off, widgets can be placed and resized freely.
</P>

<P CLASS="normal">
The user can set the virtual console to exclusively receive all keyboard input in operate mode. Also, 
key repeating can (and should!) be turned off to prevent flickering caused by the computer emulating
the user repeatedly pressing and releasing a key.
</P>

<P CLASS="normal">
On the left side of virtual console, are always two speed sliders that are always assigned to buses 
number 1 (Default Fade) and 2 (Default Hold). These sliders can be hidden from view either from a 
menu item, or pressing the "Hide" button.
</P>

<P CLASS="normal">
All widgets described below, can be configured thru a popup-menu that can be invoked only in design 
mode by right mouse-click over the widget. This menu is available only in design mode.
</P>

<P CLASS="normal">
In design mode, all widgets draw a resize area in their lower-right corners. By keeping the mouse left 
button pressed over the resize area and moving the mouse, the user can resize the widget. Left mouse 
button press over the widget starts to move the widget, again only in design mode.
</P>

<P CLASS="normal">
<B>Buttons</B>
</P>

<P CLASS="normal">
The virtual console can house any number of button-like widgets. The button size and placement can be 
adjusted within the virtual console. The button has text and color or an image as foreground.
</P>

<P CLASS="normal">
One function can be assigned to each button. When a function is assigned to a button, that button's 
tooltip is set to reflect the device (or Global) that function belongs to and the function's name.
</P>
 
<P CLASS="normal">
A button can be set to behave like a locking push button; pressed, the assigned function is run until 
it stops by itself; or depressed again, causing the button to unlock, explicitly stopping the function 
as soon as possible.
</P>

<P CLASS="normal">
A button can be set to behave like a flash button; when the button is pressed, the function is kept 
running until the function stops by itself or the button is released and the function is stopped 
explicitly by the button.
</P>

<P CLASS="normal">
Each button can have a keyboard key combination assigned to it acting the same way as if the button 
was pressed with the mouse cursor.
</P>

<P CLASS="normal">
<B>Sliders</B>
</P>

<P CLASS="normal">
The virtual console can house any number of slider-like widgets. The slider size and placement can be 
adjusted within the virtual console. 
</P>

<P CLASS="normal">
One scene or collection can be assigned to a slider, which can then be used manually to fade the values 
in the assigned function; Scene value type "set" is interpreted as "fade" and "NoSet" type values are 
ignored. When a function is assigned to a slider, that slider's tooltip is set to reflect the device 
(or Global) that function belongs to and the function name. 
</P>

<P CLASS="normal">
A slider can be assigned one or more individual channels not regarding which device they might belong 
to; the slider is then used to directly set those channel's values. Possible scenes accessing these 
channels have no effect to the slider's operation. If one channel is assigned to a slider, the absolute 
channel number is placed under the slider as info text, which can be edited by the user. If multiple 
channels are assigned to a slider, the channel numbers are set to the slider's tooltip and the slider's 
info text must be set by the user. If one or more channels are assigned to a slider, the value set to 
those channels is displayed above the slider.
</P>

<P CLASS="normal">
A slider can be set to behave as a speed setting slider that directly sets a value to its assigned bus.
Any bus can be assigned to any speed slider. When a bus value is updated, all speed sliders assigned to
the bus will track the change by moving themselves to reflect the changed value.
</P>

<P CLASS="normal">
<B>Frames</B>
</P>

<P CLASS="normal">
The virtual console can house any number of frame-like widgets that are used to group any number of
widgets together. The frame size and placement can be adjusted within the virtual console. The frame
background can be a color or an image.
</P>

<P CLASS="normal">
<B>Labels</B>
</P>

<P CLASS="normal">
The virtual console can house any number of text labels. The text label size and placement can be 
adjusted within the virtual console. The text, font, foreground color and background color can be 
modified. The label can also have a background image.
</P>
