<H2>Purpose</H2>

<P>
Q Light Controller (QLC for short) is meant to control lighting equipment used
in various performances, like live concerts and theatres etc. The main purpose is
that QLC could outperform commercial lighting desks with an intuitive and flexible
user interface.
</P>

<H2>Modes</H2>

<P>
Q Light Controller is based on the common concept of having two distinct operational
modes to prevent accidental or otherwise harmful changes during operation. Design mode
is meant to edit the behaviour of the program; create and edit functions and fixtures
and how they work. Operate mode is meant to execute the created functions that
eventually control your lighting fixtures.
</P>

<H2>Fixtures</H2>

<P>
The software is based on the DMX512 standard which defines the number of universes,
number of channels and value range for all channels, as well as other protocol-related
information. QLC supports the use of 8 DMX universes, each consisting of 512 channels,
each channel having an integer value between 0 and 255. DMX access is achieved thru
the DMX4Linux driver suite. Additional protocols can be supported thru custom made
plugins (for example the 128-channel midiout plugin). It is also possible to run
QLC without actual DMX hardware for offline editing.
</P>

<P>
The user can store shared fixture information in a fixture library that contains
the following properties on each fixture:
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
* Manufacturer and model (e.g. Manufacturer:Martin, Model:MAC550).
<BR>
* Type (Dimmer, Color changer, Scanner, Moving head, Fogger, Hazer, Fan, Others)
<BR>
* Number of channels (1-512).
<BR>
* Description of each channel's purpose (e.g. Gobo, Color, Speed etc.)
<BR>
* Value ranges in each channel representing a special functionality (e.g. 0-5:Lamp on)
<BR>
</P>

<P>
These fixture entries can then be used to create fixture instances (256 at most at a time),
that will, after instantiation, have additional properties defined by the user:
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
* DMX Address
<BR>
* DMX Universe
<BR>
* Name
<BR>
</P>

<P>
Several instances of one fixture can be created. Each fixture can be named, but the name is
not used internally to discern fixture instances from one another. The same goes for the DMX address.
So you can have any number of devices with the same name and/or address, if you feel that doing so
serves a purpose.
</P>

<H2>Functions</H2>

<P>
The user can create a number of functions, that are used to automate the setting of values to channels.
The different function types are: scene, chaser, EFX, collection and sequence. Each function can be
named, but the name is not used internally to discern one function from another, although it is
encouraged that the user gives functions descriptive names (for his own good).
</P>

<H3>Speed Setting</H3>

<P>
Functions have a speed setting that is set by the user. A maximum of 32 different speed settings called
buses, are possible. One function can have exactly one bus and many functions can share a bus. The speed
settings can be changed at any time with a resolution of 1/64 seconds. Any of the buses can be assigned
in design mode to any function. A name can be assigned to each of the buses, for convenience and clarity.
</P>

<P>
The names of the first two buses are fixed to "Fade" and "Hold". Functions' completion times and their
run-time accuracy in value setting can be late or early 10 milliseconds on average. The user is able to
quickly stop all running functions (pressing a panic button) in case something disastrous happens.
</P>

<A NAME="Scene" HREF="#Scene"><H3>Scene</H3></A>

<P>
A scene function encapsulates the values of all channels held by one fixture instance. Each stored value
holds information on the style that the value will be set once the scene function is activated. Possible
value types (styles) are:
<BR>
&nbsp;
</BR>
* Fade
<BR>
* Set
<BR>
* NoSet
<BR>
</P>

<P>
Of these, "NoSet" means that the value of the channel must not be touched at all. "Set" value is set at
the very instant when the function is executed. "Fade" value is namely faded from the value that the
channel currently has, to the value specified in the scene, smoothly during the given time span (e.g.
speed bus value). The execution of a scene takes always the time specified as the function's speed,
regardless of whether the channel values are already those specified in the scene or all values are of
type "Set" or "NoSet".
</P>

<P>
Bus number 1 (Default Fade) is assigned to all newly created scenes by default. The bus value is used
as the overall time given to fade the scene channels from their current values to the ones defined in
the scene.
</P>

<P>
A copy of a scene function can be created to the same fixture that the original is assigned to, or to
another fixture. All scene properties are copied to the duplicated scene. If the target fixture has less
channels than the originating fixture, excess channels are cropped from the copy. If the target fixture
has more channels than the originating fixture, the extra channels are set to zero value with "NoSet"
type. After copying, the two functions are completely independent function entities. Scenes can also be
moved between fixtures with the same rules.
</P>

<A NAME="EFX" HREF="#EFX"><H3>EFX</H3></A>

<P>
An EFX function is mainly used to automate moving lights (e.g. scanners & moving heads). The EFX can
create complex mathematical paths to an X-Y plane that are converted to DMX values for the fixture's
pan and tilt channels.
</P>

<P>
Bus number 1 (Default Fade) is assigned to all newly created EFX's by default. The bus value is used
as the overall time for an EFX to complete one cycle (i.e. in a circle algorithm it is the time
given to complete a full 360 degree circle).
</P>

<P>
A copy of an EFX function can be created to the same fixture that the original is assigned to, or to
another fixture. All EFX properties are copied to the duplicated EFX. Channel mappings are done using
direct channel numbers (e.g. 1=1, 2=2 etc.). If the target fixture has less channels than the
originating fixture, excess channels are cropped from the copy. After copying, the two functions are
completely independent function entities. EFX's can also be moved between fixtures with the same rules.
</P>

<A NAME="Sequence" HREF="#Sequence"><H3>Sequence</H3></A>

<P>
A sequence function is also used to automate moving lights (e.g. scanners & moving heads). The big
difference between an EFX and a sequence is that you must enter each step manually for sequences,
while EFX's will create the steps automatically using different mathematical formulae. Also, you can
enter values for each channel of a fixture in a sequence function, while EFX's operate solely on
pan and tilt channels.
</P>

<P>
Bus number 2 (Default Hold) is assigned to all newly created sequences by default. The bus value is
used as hold time between steps.
</P>

<P>
A copy of a sequence function can be created to the same fixture that the original is assigned to, or
to another fixture. All sequence properties are copied to the duplicated sequence. If the target
fixture has less channels than the originating fixture, excess channels are cropped from the copy.
If the target fixture has more channels than the originating fixture, the extra channels are set to
zero value with "NoSet" type. After copying, the two functions are completely independent function
entities. Sequences can also be moved between fixtures with the same rules.
</P>

<A NAME="Collection" HREF="#Collection"><H3>Collection</H3></A>

<P>
A collection function encapsulates multiple functions that are executed simultaneously when the
collection function is executed. Any number of functions can be inserted to a collection. One function
can be inserted only once and a collection cannot be a member of itself. The collection function is not
attached to a fixture, thus it is held in the Global function space.
</P>

<P>
The speed setting has no effect on a collection, therefore, it is not necessary to have the possibility
to assign a bus to a collection.
</P>

<P>
A copy of a collection function can be created to the global function space. The duplicated function has
the same properties as the original function. After copying, the two functions are completely
independent function entities.
</P>

<A NAME="Chaser" HREF="#Chaser"><H3>Chaser</H3></A>

<P>
A chaser function encapsulates multiple functions that are executed in serial one after another when
the chaser function is run. The next function is run after the previous has finished. Any number of
functions can be inserted to a chaser. The chaser cannot be a member of itself, although it is possible
to add for example a collection as a member that holds the same chaser. These situations should be
avoided because they create endless nested loops.
</P>

<P>
A chaser's direction can be set to (mutually exclusive):
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
* Normal (traverse the functions from the beginning to the end)
<BR>
* Reverse (traverse the functions from the end to the beginning)
</P>

<P>
The run order can be set to (mutually exclusive):
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
* Loop (loop indefinitely, jump to the first after executing the last function)
<BR>
* Single-shot (traverse the functions thru once and stop)
<BR>
* Ping-Pong (loop indefinitely, but reverse the direction at both ends)
<BR>
</P>

<P>
The direction setting has effect on run order as described.
</P>

<P>
Bus number 2 (Default Hold) is assigned to all newly created chasers by default. The bus value
is used as hold time between steps.
</P>

<P>
A copy of a chaser function can be created to the global function space. The duplicated function has
the same properties as the original function. After copying, the two functions are completely
independent function entities.
</P>

<H2>Virtual Console</H2>

<P>
The primary purpose of the virtual console is to act as an open sandbox where the user can create
a lighting desk of his/her choice. <A HREF="virtualconsole.html">Read more...</A>
