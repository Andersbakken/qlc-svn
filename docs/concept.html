<P>
Q Light Controller (QLC for short) is meant to control lighting equipment used
in various performances, like live concerts and theatres etc. The main purpose
is that QLC could outperform commercial lighting desks with an intuitive and
flexible user interface, without the need for a 500+ page manual.
</P>

<A NAME="Modes" HREF="#Modes"><H2>Modes</H2></A>

<P>
Q Light Controller is based on the common concept of having two distinct
operational modes to prevent accidental or otherwise harmful changes during
operation. <b>Design mode</b> is meant to edit the behaviour of the program;
create and edit functions and fixtures and how they work. <b>Operate mode</b>
is meant to execute the created functions that eventually control your
lighting fixtures.
</P>

<A NAME="Output" HREF="#Output"><H2>Output</H2></A>

<P>
DMX output is achieved thru output plugins that can support one or more
physical DMX universes. It is also possible to run QLC without actual DMX
hardware.
</P>

<A NAME="Input" HREF="#Input"><H2>Input</H2></A>

<P>
Primary input methods for QLC are naturally the keyboard and mouse. Users can
attach keyboard keys to virtual console buttons and drag sliders and do pretty
much everything with a mouse.
</P>

<P>
Special input plugins provide capabilities for getting external devices (mainly
slider boards) to provide input data to QLC elements. These input devices can
be attached to virtual console widgets to eliminate the need for controlling
a lighting show with a clumsy mouse or keyboard. External input can be used
also to edit some function contents.
</P>

<A NAME="Fixtures" HREF="#Fixtures"><H2>Fixtures</H2></A>

<P>
The software is based on the DMX512 standard, which defines the number of
channels and their value range, as well as other protocol-related information.
QLC supports 4 individual DMX universes, each consisting of 512 channels,
each channel having an integer value between 0 and 255.
</P>

<P>
Users can store shared fixture information in a fixture library that contains
the following properties for each fixture:<BR>
<LI>Manufacturer (e.g. Martin)</LI>
<LI>Model (e.g. MAC250)</LI>
<LI>Type (Color Changer, Scanner, Moving Head, Smoke, Haze, Fan...)</LI>
<LI>Channels:</LI>
<UL>
 <LI>Channel group (Pan, Tilt, Gobo, Color, Speed etc.)</LI>
 <LI>8bit and 16bit channel bindings for pan & tilt groups
 <LI>Value ranges for channel features (e.g. 0-5:Lamp on, 6-15:Strobe etc..)
</UL>
</P>

<P>
These fixture entries can then be used to create fixture instances (256 at most
at a time), that will, after instantiation, have additional properties defined
by users:<BR>
<LI>DMX Universe</LI>
<LI>DMX Address</LI>
<LI>Name</LI>
</P>

<P>
Several instances of a fixture can be created (i.e. users must be able to
have several instances of a MAC250 in use). Each fixture can be named, but the
name is not used internally to identify individual fixture instances. The same
goes for the DMX address. Nevertheless users are encouraged to name their
fixtures in some systematic way to help identify each of them -- if necessary.
</P>

<P>
Generic dimmer devices don't need their own fixture definitions, because usually
multiple dimmers are patched into a common address space, employing one or more
dimmers. Users can create instances of these generic dimmer entities just by
defining the number of channels each one of them should use.
</P>

<A NAME="Functions" HREF="#Functions"><H2>Functions</H2></A>

<P>
Users can create 4096 functions, that are used to automate the setting of
values to channels. The different function types are:<BR>
<LI>Scene</LI>
<LI>Chaser</LI>
<LI>EFX</LI>
<LI>Collection</LI>
<BR>
Each function can be named, but the name is not used internally to identify
individual functions. Nevertheless users are encouraged to name their functions
in some systematic way to help identify each of them -- if necessary.
</P>

<A NAME="Buses" HREF="#Buses"><H3>Speed Setting (buses)</H3></A>

<P>
Functions have a speed setting that is set by users. A maximum of 32 different
speed settings called buses, are possible. One function can have exactly one
bus and many functions can share one bus. The speed settings can be changed at
any time with a resolution of 1/64 seconds. Any of the buses can be assigned
in design mode to any function (except collection-type functions, which have
no meaning for a speed). A name can be assigned to each of the buses, for
convenience and to help identification.
</P>

<P>
The names of the first two buses are, by default, "Fade" and "Hold". Functions'
completion times and their run-time accuracy in value setting can be late or
early 10 milliseconds on average. The user is able to quickly stop all running
functions (pressing a panic button) in case something disastrous happens.
</P>

<A NAME="Scene" HREF="#Scene"><H3>Scene</H3></A>

<P>
A scene function encapsulates the values of selected channels owned by one or
more fixture instances. When a scene is started, the duration it takes for the
values to reach their target depends on the function's speed setting (see the
section on <I>Speed Setting</I> above). Bus number 1 (Default Fade) is
assigned to all newly created scenes by default. If the bus' value is 0 seconds,
the scene values are set immediately and no fading occurs. Otherwise the values
are always faded from what they currently are, to the target values defined in
the scene. Channels that are not enabled in the scene will not be touched.
</P>

<P>
Copies of scene functions can be created within the 4096 total function limit.
All of the function's contents are copied to the duplicate. After copying, the
two functions are completely independent entities that behave exactly the same.
</P>

<A NAME="EFX" HREF="#EFX"><H3>EFX</H3></A>

<P>
An EFX function is mainly used to automate moving lights (e.g. scanners &
moving heads). The EFX can create complex mathematical paths on an X-Y plane
that are converted to DMX values for the fixture's pan and tilt channels.
<B>Only fixtures that contain valid pan & tilt channels can take part in an
EFX function.</B>
</P>

<P>
Bus number 1 (Default Fade) is assigned to all newly created EFX's by default.
The bus value is used as the overall time for the EFX algorithm to complete
one cycle. In other words, with a circle algorithm, the bus value is understood
as the time available to complete a full 360 degree circle.
</P>

<P>
EFX functions can have special start and stop scenes, that are run just before
the EFX is started and immediately after the EFX stops. These scenes are not,
however, faded as would happen with a normal scene, but instead, they are
set immediately, as if the speed set thru their bus was set to zero.
</P>

<P>
Fixtures taking part in an EFX function can be set to follow the algorithm
either in parallel (all fixtures following the same pattern synchronously) or
in serial (fixtures start following the pattern one after another, with a
little delay in-between, creating a more lively, wave-like effect).
</P>

<P>
EFX functions' direction can be reversed for all fixtures at once or on a
per-fixture basis. The function can also be set to do an infinte loop, an
infinite ping-pong-loop (direction is reversed after each pass) or it can run
thru just once, in a single-shot mode, after which it terminates by itself.
If the function is set to do an infinite loop, it must be stopped manually.
</P>

<P>
Copies of EFX functions can be created within the 4096 total function limit.
All of the function's contents are copied to the duplicate. After copying, the
two functions are completely independent entities that behave exactly the same.
</P>

<A NAME="Chaser" HREF="#Chaser"><H3>Chaser</H3></A>

<P>
A chaser function encapsulates multiple scenes that are executed in serial one
after the other when the chaser function is run. The next function is run
after the previous has finished. Any number of scenes can be inserted to a
chaser.
</P>

<P>
Chaser functions' direction can be reversed. The function can also be set to do
an infinite loop, an infinite ping-pong-loop (direction is reversed after
each pass) or it can run thru just once, in a single-shot mode, after which it
terminates by itself. If the function is set to do an infinite loop, it must
be stopped manually.
</P>

<P>
Bus number 2 (Default Hold) is assigned to all newly created chasers by
default. The bus value is used as hold time between steps. Fade time for the
chaser's member scene functions is set thru the scene function's own speed
buses.
</P>

<P>
Copies of chaser functions can be created within the 4096 total function limit.
All of the function's contents are copied to the duplicate. After copying, the
two functions are completely independent entities that behave exactly the same.
</P>

<A NAME="Collection" HREF="#Collection"><H3>Collection</H3></A>

<P>
A collection function encapsulates multiple functions that are executed
simultaneously when the collection function is executed. Any number of
functions can be inserted to a collection. One function can be inserted only
once and a collection cannot be a member of itself.
</P>

<P>
Speed setting has no effect on a collection. The collection's functions' speeds
are set individually by its member functions' buses.
</P>

<P>
Copies of collection functions can be created within the 4096 total function
limit. All of the function's contents are copied to the duplicate. After
copying, the two functions are completely independent entities that behave
exactly the same.
</P>

<A NAME="VirtualConsole" HREF="#VirtualConsole"><H2>Virtual Console</H2></A>

<P>
The purpose of the virtual console is to act as an open sandbox where the user
can create a lighting desk layout of his choice. Users can create various GUI
(Graphical User Interface) elements, called widgets, onto the console surface:
<BR>
<LI>Buttons for starting and stopping functions</LI>
<LI>Sliders for adjusting selected bus or channel values</LI>
<LI>XY Pads for manually moving intelligent light beams</LI>
<LI>Cue lists for theatrical performance purposes</LI>
<LI>Frames for grouping various widgets together</LI>
<LI>Labels to act as static information banners for other widgets</LI>
