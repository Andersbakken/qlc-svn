<H2>Virtual Console</H2>

<P>
The virtual console is essentially a "drawing area", that is initially empty.
Users can add, remove and edit various widgets that are used to construct a
custom lighting console. Lighting automation is primarily controlled thru the
virtual console, although very limited control is possible thru each fixture's
own console.
</P>

<P>
The virtual console background can be a color or a tiled image. Users can
restrict the movement and sizing of the GUI elements (widgets) as if they were
laid on a grid. The grid can have a resolution between 1-100 pixels
independently for x- and y-axes and the grid can be turned on or off. If the
grid is turned off, widgets can be placed and resized freely.
</P>

<P>
Users can set the virtual console to exclusively receive all keyboard input in
operate mode. Also, key repeating can (and should!) be turned off to prevent
flickering caused by computers' habit of continuously generating key press
events as long as a key is pressed.
</P>

<P>
On the left side of virtual console, are two speed sliders that are always
assigned to buses number 1 (Default Fade) and 2 (Default Hold). These sliders
can be hidden with a menu item under the Tools menu. The sliders can be
configured thru the virtual console properties dialog.
</P>

<P>
All widgets described in the next section can be configured thru a popup-menu
that is invoked by clicking the right mouse button over the widget. Note that
this menu along with all configuration options are available only when the
application is in design mode.
</P>

<P>
In design mode, all widgets draw a resize handle in their lower-right corners.
By keeping the mouse left button pressed over the resize area and moving the
mouse, users can resize these widgets. Left mouse button press over the widget
starts to move the widget. In operate mode, all editing capabilities of the
virtual console are disabled to prevent users from making accidental changes.
</P>

<H3>Buttons</H3>

<P>
The virtual console can contain any number of button-like widgets. Button
size and placement can be adjusted within the virtual console. The button has
text and color or an image as foreground.
</P>

<P>
One function can be assigned to each button. When a function is assigned to a
button, that button's tooltip is set to display the function's name.
</P>

<P>
A button can be set to behave like a locking push button; pressed, the
assigned function is run until it stops by itself; or depressed again,
causing the button to unlock, explicitly stopping the function as soon as
possible.
</P>

<P>
A button can be set to behave like a flash button; when the button is pressed,
the function is kept running until the function stops by itself or the button
is released and the function is stopped explicitly by the button.
</P>

<P>
Each button can have a keyboard key combination assigned to it acting the same
way as if the button was pressed with the mouse cursor.
</P>

<H3>Sliders</H3>

<P>
The virtual console can house any number of slider-like widgets. The slider size and placement can be
adjusted within the virtual console.
</P>

<P>
One scene or collection can be assigned to a slider, which can then be used manually to fade the values
in the assigned function; Scene value type "set" is interpreted as "fade" and "NoSet" type values are
ignored. When a function is assigned to a slider, that slider's tooltip is set to reflect the fixture
(or Global) that function belongs to and the function name.
</P>

<P>
A slider can be assigned one or more individual channels not regarding which fixture they might belong
to; the slider is then used to directly set those channel's values. Possible scenes accessing these
channels have no effect to the slider's operation. If one channel is assigned to a slider, the absolute
channel number is placed under the slider as info text, which can be edited by the user. If multiple
channels are assigned to a slider, the channel numbers are set to the slider's tooltip and the slider's
info text must be set by the user. If one or more channels are assigned to a slider, the value set to
those channels is displayed above the slider.
</P>

<P>
A slider can be set to behave as a speed setting slider that directly sets a value to its assigned bus.
Any bus can be assigned to any speed slider. When a bus value is updated, all speed sliders assigned to
the bus will track the change by moving themselves to reflect the changed value.
</P>

<H3>XY-Pads</H3>

<P>
The virtual console can house any number of XY-Pads. The pad's size and placement can be adjusted
within the virtual console. The main idea is to drag the position indicator over the pad area with
a mouse or a trackball, which then converts the movement over X and Y axes to DMX channel (Pan and
Tilt) values. The pad is targeted for manual control of moving lights (with a mouse), although it can
be used for any purpose.  Each pad has X- and Y-axes and both of these axes can have any number of
channels assigned to them. Each channel assignment can have either direct or reverse control over
the channel's value. Each channel assignment has also a DMX value range, in which to operate as
the position indicator is moved over the pad area.
</P>

<H3>Frames</H3>

<P>
The virtual console can house any number of frame-like widgets that are used to group any number of
widgets together. The frame size and placement can be adjusted within the virtual console. The frame
background can be a color or an image.
</P>

<P>
Each frame containing buttons can be se to behave as a button-exclusive group. When the exclusive
feature is turned on for a frame, only one button in the frame can be active at a time. This is
quite handy if you, for example, wish to quickly switch over from one chaser to another. Having an
exclusive parent frame does not have any effect on child frames, their children or other non-button
widgets.
</P>

<H3>Labels</H3>

<P>
The virtual console can house any number of text labels. The text label size and placement can be
adjusted within the virtual console. The text, font, foreground color and background color can be
modified. The label can also have a background image.
