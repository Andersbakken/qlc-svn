<P>
The virtual console is essentially a "drawing area", that is initially empty. The user can add and
remove buttons, sliders, frames and labels that are used to construct a custom lighting console. The
lighting automation is primarily controlled thru the virtual console, although limited control is also
possible thru the fixture console.
</P>

<P>
The virtual console background can be a color or a tiled image. The user can restrict the movement and
sizes of the GUI elements (widgets) as if they were on a grid. The grid can have a resolution between
1-100 pixels independently for x- and y-axes and the grid can be turned on or off. If the grid is
turned off, widgets can be placed and resized freely.
</P>

<P>
The user can set the virtual console to exclusively receive all keyboard input in operate mode. Also,
key repeating can (and should!) be turned off to prevent flickering caused by computers' habit of
continuously generating key press events as long as a key is pressed.
</P>

<P>
On the left side of virtual console, are always two speed sliders that are always assigned to buses
number 1 (Default Fade) and 2 (Default Hold). These sliders can be hidden from view either from a
menu item, or pressing the "Hide" button.
</P>

<P>
All widgets described below, can be configured thru a popup-menu that can be invoked by clicking the
right mouse button over the widget. Note that this menu is available only in design mode.
</P>

<P>
In design mode, all widgets draw a resize area in their lower-right corners. By keeping the mouse left
button pressed over the resize area and moving the mouse, the user can resize the widget. Left mouse
button press over the widget starts to move the widget.
</P>

<P>
In operate mode, all editing capabilities of the virtual console widgets are disabled to prevent the
user from making accidental changes. Buttons can only be pressed/released, sliders can only be moved
and XY-Pads can only be used to drag the position indicator. Labels and frames don't have any user
actions in operate mode.
</P>

<H3>Buttons</H3>

<P>
The virtual console can house any number of button-like widgets. The button size and placement can be
adjusted within the virtual console. The button has text and color or an image as foreground.
</P>

<P>
One function can be assigned to each button. When a function is assigned to a button, that button's
tooltip is set to reflect the fixture (or Global) that function belongs to and the function's name.
</P>

<P>
A button can be set to behave like a locking push button; pressed, the assigned function is run until
it stops by itself; or depressed again, causing the button to unlock, explicitly stopping the function
as soon as possible.
</P>

<P>
A button can be set to behave like a flash button; when the button is pressed, the function is kept
running until the function stops by itself or the button is released and the function is stopped
explicitly by the button.
</P>

<P>
Each button can have a keyboard key combination assigned to it acting the same way as if the button
was pressed with the mouse cursor.
</P>

<H3>Sliders</H3>

<P>
The virtual console can house any number of slider-like widgets. The slider size and placement can be
adjusted within the virtual console.
</P>

<P>
One scene or collection can be assigned to a slider, which can then be used manually to fade the values
in the assigned function; Scene value type "set" is interpreted as "fade" and "NoSet" type values are
ignored. When a function is assigned to a slider, that slider's tooltip is set to reflect the fixture
(or Global) that function belongs to and the function name.
</P>

<P>
A slider can be assigned one or more individual channels not regarding which fixture they might belong
to; the slider is then used to directly set those channel's values. Possible scenes accessing these
channels have no effect to the slider's operation. If one channel is assigned to a slider, the absolute
channel number is placed under the slider as info text, which can be edited by the user. If multiple
channels are assigned to a slider, the channel numbers are set to the slider's tooltip and the slider's
info text must be set by the user. If one or more channels are assigned to a slider, the value set to
those channels is displayed above the slider.
</P>

<P>
A slider can be set to behave as a speed setting slider that directly sets a value to its assigned bus.
Any bus can be assigned to any speed slider. When a bus value is updated, all speed sliders assigned to
the bus will track the change by moving themselves to reflect the changed value.
</P>

<H3>XY-Pads</H3>

<P>
The virtual console can house any number of XY-Pads. The pad's size and placement can be adjusted
within the virtual console. The main idea is to drag the position indicator over the pad area with
a mouse or a trackball, which then converts the movement over X and Y axes to DMX channel (Pan and
Tilt) values. The pad is targeted for manual control of moving lights (with a mouse), although it can
be used for any purpose.  Each pad has X- and Y-axes and both of these axes can have any number of
channels assigned to them. Each channel assignment can have either direct or reverse control over
the channel's value. Each channel assignment has also a DMX value range, in which to operate as
the position indicator is moved over the pad area.
</P>

<H3>Frames</H3>

<P>
The virtual console can house any number of frame-like widgets that are used to group any number of
widgets together. The frame size and placement can be adjusted within the virtual console. The frame
background can be a color or an image.
</P>

<P>
Each frame containing buttons can be se to behave as a button-exclusive group. When the exclusive
feature is turned on for a frame, only one button in the frame can be active at a time. This is
quite handy if you, for example, wish to quickly switch over from one chaser to another. Having an
exclusive parent frame does not have any effect on child frames, their children or other non-button
widgets.
</P>

<H3>Labels</H3>

<P>
The virtual console can house any number of text labels. The text label size and placement can be
adjusted within the virtual console. The text, font, foreground color and background color can be
modified. The label can also have a background image.
