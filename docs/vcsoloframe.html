<P>
A Solo Frame is almost exactly the same kind of a container as a normal
<A HREF="vcframe.html">Frame</A> that can hold other widgets and other frames
inside. However, the difference with Solo Frame is that it treats any
<A HREF="vcbutton.html">Buttons</A> inside it a bit differently by allowing
<U>only one</U> button to be depressed at a time. For example, consider you have
<B>Button A</B> and <B>Button B</B> inside a Solo Frame with <B>Button A</B>
currently depressed. Next, you click button <B>Button B</B> which automatically
results in <B>Button A</B> being released, leaving now only <B>Button B</B>
depressed.

<H3>Configuration</H3>

<P>
Solo Frames have no configurable options whatsoever. You can only change their
<A HREF="vcstylingplacement.html">styling &amp; placement options</A> just like
all other Virtual Console widgets.
