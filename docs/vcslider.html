<H1>Virtual Console Slider</H1>
<IMG SRC="qrc:/slider.png" ALIGN="absmiddle">
<P>
Sliders are used for two distinct purposes: <A HREF="concept.html#Buses">Bus</A>
speed setting (<B>Bus</B> slider mode) and <A HREF="concept.html#Fixture">Fixture</A>
channel level setting (<B>Level</B> slider mode). Every slider can operate on
either of these modes and each mode has its own configuration options.
</P>

<P>
Essentially, the slider sets directly the value for a bus or a collection of
channels picked from fixtures in the workspace when the application is in
<A HREF="concept.html#Modes">Operate Mode</A>.
</P>

<P> 
When the slider has been set to operate on <B>Bus</B> mode, an additional
<U>tap button</U> appears at the bottom of the slider; this button can be used
to set the bus time by tapping the button in time with the beat of the currently
playing song. The bus value is taken from the time between taps.
</P>

<H3>Configuration</H3>

<P>
Sliders can be configured with the properties
<IMG SRC="qrc:/configure.png" ALIGN="bottom"> button found in the toolbar or
with the <B>Edit -&gt; Properties</B> menu item.
</P>

<H3>Configuration - General Tab</H3>

<P>
The General tab holds all of the sliders properties that are shared between
<B>Bus</B> and <B>Level</B> modes.

    slider. The latest combination is shown on the text boxes when QLC receives
    input data. If you don't see anything in the boxes, your input connection
    might have a problem that you need to fix first.</LI>
