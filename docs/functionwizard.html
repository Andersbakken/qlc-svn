<H1>Function Wizard</H1>
<P>
The Function Wizard's purpose is to help users create some common functions to
get started quickly. The wizard creates scenes for all pre-defined colour &amp; gobo
capabilities of intelligent lights so that fixtures change colour or gobo
simultaneously. All Intensity channels are included in a few simple chasers...
