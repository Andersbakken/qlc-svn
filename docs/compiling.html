      This document discusses issues related to compiling Q Light Controller 2
      from source files. It is assumed that the user is installing QLC with the default
      settings.

    <H3>Directory structure</H3>
    <P CLASS="normal">
      QLC2 source distribution is divided in directories in order to keep
      different file types in their own directory. <B>qlc2</B> is the topmost
      directory that houses all the directories that are
      included in QLC source distribution.

    <H3>Configuration</H3>
    <P CLASS="normal">
      In most cases, qlc doesn't require any configuration if you have
      all the necessary libraries installed on your Linux system. The most
      common cases of unsuccessful compile operations are missing or
      incorrect library/include directories. There is a special file for
      library path settings in <B>qlc2</B> called <B>config.make</B>.
      This file looks like this by default:
      <PRE>

      </PRE>
      
      Check that each library path is set correctly. The <I>QTDIR</I>
      variable is a special case: if you have QT correctly installed,
      your system should have the environment variable <I>QTDIR</I> pointing
      to the correct path. This is why it is commented on the config.make
      file. If you have problems with QT libraries, try to set this directory
      manually. You can check for the presence of this environment variable
      by typing "<B>set | grep QTDIR</B>" in shell prompt.
    </P>
    
    <H3>Compiling</H3>
    <P CLASS="normal">
      If everything is in order, you should be able to compile QLC by saying
      <PRE>
	make
      </PRE>
      in <B>qlc2</B> directory. After that, to install QLC to the path
      specified in <I>SYSTEMPATH</I> variable in <B>config.make</B>
      (<B>/usr/local/qlc</B> by default) you type
      <PRE>
	make install
      </PRE>
      in <B>qlc2</B> directory. After that typing
      "<B>/usr/local/qlc/bin/qlc</B>" starts the application.
