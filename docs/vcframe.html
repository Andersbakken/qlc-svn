<P>
A Frame is a container that can hold other widgets and other frames inside. In
fact, the whole Virtual Console is already your bottom-most frame. Also, if you
apply some <A HREF="vcstylingplacement.html">styling attributes</A> to a frame,
all of its children (that don't have their own non-default style settings) also
inherit their parent's style properties.
</P>

<H3>Configuration</H3>

<P>
Frames have no configurable options whatsoever. You can only change their
<A HREF="vcstylingplacement.html">styling &amp; placement options</A> just like
all other Virtual Console widgets.
