<H1>Output Mapping</H1>
</CENTER>

<P>
This howto document tells you how to patch output plugins and their output
lines (physical output universes) to QLC's internal output universes.
</P>

<H2>Output Manager</H2>

<B>Click the <u>Outputs</u> item from the main window's <u>Manager</u> menu.</B>

<P>
A window is opened with title <u>Output Manager</u>. There's a list of internal
universes, plugins and outputs, with a toolbar on top of the list with just one
button:
</P>

<HR>

<P>
Each of these internal universes can have one output plugin and one output
line from that plugin assigned to them. In other words, the DMX control data
that you create with QLC, is first sent to one of QLC's internal universes.
From there, the data is sent to the output plugin that is assigned to that
particular universe and the plugin sends the data yet again to one of its
output lines. With this approach, one plugin can provide multiple physical
universes.
</P>

<H2>Mapping Properties</H2>

<B>Select <u>universe 1</u> and then click the
<IMG SRC="../gfx/edit.png" ALIGN="absmiddle"> edit button to edit the first
universe's mapping properties.</B>

<P>
A dialog opens with a list of available plugins. If you open these plugin
nodes (click the little "+" sign) you can see a list of physical output lines
that each plugin provides.
</P>

<P>
Below the list is a text field that displays some information on the selected
plugin and/or output line that you have currently selected.
</P>

<P>
Right next to the text field is a
<IMG SRC="../gfx/configure.png" ALIGN="absmiddle"> configuration button that
lets you access a dialog with which you can configure the selected plugin.
Each plugin's configuration window differs slightly from one another because
different plugins require different kinds of options and it has been left to
the plugin developers to decide the configuration dialog layout. Note that not
all plugins necessarily provide this option (like the <u>Dummy Output</u>
plugin for example).
</P>

<P>
Some plugins might require some configuration before they can be used so you
might not be able to see all outputs at first.
</P>

<H2>Patching</H2>

<P>
To patch a plugin's output line to the selected universe, you need to place
a checkmark on that particular plugin's output line. You can have only one
line assigned to a universe at a time, so when you check another line, the
checkmark will <u>move</u> from its previous position to the one you checked.
</P>

<B>
Place the checkmark on <u>Dummy Output</u> plugin's output line called
<u>4: Dummy Out 4</u> and then click OK to accept and close the dialog.
</B>

<H2>Back in the output manager</H2>

<P>
Take a look at the list in <u>Output Manager</u>. Universe 1 should now be
patched to <u>Dummy Output</u> plugin's </u>4: Dummy Out 4</u> output line.
To modify the mapping and select other plugins' outputs, just repeat the
steps described in this document.
