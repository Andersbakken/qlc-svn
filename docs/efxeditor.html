<H1>EFX Editor</H1>
<P>
The EFX editor, as its name suggests, is used to edit
<A HREF="concept.html#EFX">EFX</A> functions. The dialog is split in three tabs:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>The first, <B>General</B> tab is for selecting <A HREF="concept.html#Fixture">Fixtures</A>, the speed <A HREF="concept.html#Buses">bus</A> and the fixture order.</LI>
<LI>The second, <B>Movement</B> tab is for selecting details on how the fixtures should move their heads/mirrors.</LI>
<LI>The third, <B>Initialization</B> tab is used to tell how the fixtures should initialize themselves prior to actually moving and how they should de-initialize themselves after their movement is complete.</LI>
</UL>

<H3>Initialization Tab Controls</H3>

<TABLE BORDER="1">
 <TR>
  <TD>
   <B>Initialize fixtures</B>
  </TD>
  <TD>
   If checked, fixtures are initialized using values from a scene selected from
   the <B>Scene</B> list. When <B>serial</B> mode has been selected from the
   <B>General</B> tab, each fixture is initialized separately just before starting
   their movement. When <B>parallel</B> mode has been selected, all fixtures are
   initialized simultaneously when movement starts. <B>NOTE:</B> If the selected
   scene does not contain values affecting the EFX's fixtures, no initialization
   occurs.
  </TD>
 </TR>
 <TR>
  <TD>
   <B>De-initialize fixtures</B>
  </TD>
  <TD>
   If checked, fixtures are de-initialized using values from a scene selected from
   the <B>Scene</B> list. The de-initialization scene is run for each fixture when
   the fixture stops movement. When <B>Single-shot</B> mode has been selected, the
   de-initialization scene is run automatically after each fixture has finished its
   movement. However, if either <B>Loop</B> or <B>Ping-pong</B> mode is selected,
   the fixtures stop movement ONLY when the user explicitly stops the EFX.
   <B>NOTE:</B> If the selected scene does not contain values affecting the EFX's
   fixtures, no de-initialization occurs.
