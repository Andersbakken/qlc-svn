<H1>Input Devices Howto</H1>
</CENTER>

This howto document tells you how to associate input devices to input universes
and how to edit these devices. You should first read the
<A HREF="howto-input-mapping.html">howto on input mapping</A> so that you
can access the input manager and know how to edit input universes.

<H1>Input Manager</H1>

<P>
<B>Click the <u>Inputs</u> item from the main window's <u>Manager</u> menu.</B>
</P>

<H2>Mapping Properties</H2>

<P>
<B>Select <u>universe 1</u> and then click the
<IMG SRC="../gfx/edit.png" ALIGN="absmiddle"> edit button to edit the first
universe's mapping properties.</B>

<P>
The dialog that opens is the same that has been covered in the 
<A HREF="howto-input-mapping.html">input mapping howto.</A> However, the
dialog contains two pages: <u>Mapping</u> and <u>Device</u> that are accessed
thru the little tabs at the top of the dialog.
</P>

<H2>Device assignment</H2>

<P>
<B>Click the <u>Device</u> tab to access the input device tab.</B>
</P>

<P>
You'll see a list of available input device definitions, with a check mark
on <u>None</u>. This means that the current universe doesn't have a device
assigned yet. To assign a device to the universe, simply place a check mark
on one of the available devices by clicking on the empty check box. Only one
device can be assigned to one universe at a time, so the check mark will
actually <u>move</u> from its previous position to the item that you have
selected.
</P>

<P>
<B>Click the white box beside <u>Behringer - BCF2000</u> to assign it to
the current universe. If you're happy with this, click OK to close the dialog
and accept these mappings.</B>
</P>

<H2>Add/Edit a Device</H2>

<P>
It is probable that your input device is not on the list and you need to create
one of your own.
</P>

<P>
<B>Click the <IMG SRC="../gfx/edit_add.png"> create new input device button
to start making a device definition for your input device. Alternatively, you
can edit any existing device by selecting the appropriate item and clicking
the <IMG SRC="../gfx/edit.png"> edit button. The procedure is exactly the
same in both cases from now on.</B>
</P>

<H2>Input Device Editor</H2>

<P>
A dialog is opened with entry fields for <u>Manufacturer</u> and <u>Model</u>.
</P>

<P>
<B>Enter the device's manufacturer and model to these fields and then click
the <u>Channels</u> tab to edit the device's channels.</B>
</P>

<P>
Now you have two choices for adding channel definitions: <u>Manual</u> and
<u>Automatic</u>:
</P>
<HR>
<P>
<IMG SRC="../gfx/edit_add.png" VALIGN="absmiddle"> Click the add button to
enter individual channel information by hand for each channel.<BR>

<IMG SRC="../gfx/wizard.png" VALIGN="absmiddle"> Click the automatic wizard
button to attempt automatic channel detection. You'll receive further
instructions from QLC. You must have an input device assigned to the current
universe for this feature to work. Also, you must first stop the wizard to
be able to navigate away from this dialog page.
</P>
<HR>

<P>
You can edit the existing channels by selecting them and clicking the
<IMG SRC="../gfx/edit.png"> edit button. To remove selected channels, click
the <IMG SRC="../gfx/edit_remove.png"> remove button.
</P>

<P>
When you <u>add</u> or <u>edit</u> a channel, you must enter the channel number,
name and type (Slider, Knob or Button). Note that you cannot add the same
channel multiple times to one device.
</P>

<P>
<B>When you're ready, click the OK button to accept changes and save the
input device. If you didn't enter a manufacturer/model for the device,
you'll be prompted to enter them before you can continue.</B>
</P>

<H2>Back in the mapping properties dialog</H2>

<P>
Now you should see the device you just defined in the list of available input
devices. Remember how to assign it to the current universe? Scroll up to
<u>Device assignment</u> if you don't.
</P>

<P>
To remove any existing input devices, click the
<IMG SRC="../gfx/edit_remove.png"> remove button. Note that some devices are
so-called <u>system devices</u> and cannot be removed unless you're the
administrator.
</P>

<P>
<B>Click OK to accept these mappings and close the dialog.</B>
